# Changelog

## [0.48.8] — 2026-06-29

Host-aware silver-doctor checks and enterprise E2E credential preflight.

### Bug Fixes
- `fix(doctor)`: host-aware checks — D8 orchestrator rule Cursor-only; D2/D3/D13 use active host plugin paths via `runtime-paths.sh` (no Cursor deps on Claude/Codex) (`e0f2234a`)
- `fix(e2e)`: fail fast when Claude token gateway credentials missing — preflight after install-claude, default settings export in live defaults (`7dd82097`)

### Tests
- `test(doctor)`: mocked-host unit tests for Claude/Codex/Cursor doctor paths (`e0f2234a`)

---

## [0.48.7] — 2026-06-29

Scoped RTK coexistence: full agent RTK when opted in; verbatim harness mode only.

### Bug Fixes

- `tests/scripts/test-multi-ai-task-models.sh` for resolver + Claude bundle prefix

---

## [0.48.4] — 2026-06-27

Recommended-tools expansion and global wiring: RTK and Context Mode opt-in gates, Alumnium opt-in, Graphify + agentmemory stack optimizer (synergy_max) across hosts, multi-agent global RTK/Context Mode optimizer, and Context Mode read-deny when enforced. Documentation and site workflow SDLC ordering; enterprise E2E fixture shift; CI/shellcheck and diagnostics fixes. Integrates doc-scheme Graphify exclusion test fix; restores opt-in Graphify gate behavior after mandatory-graphify branch merge.

## [0.48.2] — 2026-06-25

Enterprise readiness ladder run 2: FLOW-16/17 worker split (`DESIGN-HANDOFF.md` / `DOCUMENT.md`), `SECURITY.md` skill-dispatched template, catalog `skill_worker_templates` parity, depth-aware review-loop docs, core-rules hash pin enforcement, Cursor GPT-5.5 ladder slug substitutions, and review-loop safety-cap non-convergence guard.

## Bug Fixes
- Split `silver-handoff` (FLOW 16) from `silver-ensure-docs` (FLOW 17) worker templates; added `FLOW-DOCUMENT` runtime queue token.
- Split `security` vs `silver-secure` worker templates (`SECURITY.md` / `SECURE.md`) with distinct flow-log labels.
- Fixed `RELEASE.md` mandatory skill (`silver:create-release`), `ROUTER.md` colon invoke form, orchestrator flow-label CSV mappings.
- Lazy-load worker template mapper in `orchestrator-directive.sh` when sourced before `orchestrator-parent.sh`.
- Core-rules injection requires verified hash pin; missing pin injects warning instead of unpinned content.

## Tests
- Extended orchestrator handoff, workflow CSV, instruction-flow parity, worker-template parity, and review-fix-ladder coverage.

---

## [0.48.1] — 2026-06-24

Post-release APO runtime alignment, orchestrator queue fixes, and help-center refresh for the v0.48 catalog model.

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed `silver-devops` orchestrator post-exec queue token (`FLOW-QUALITY-GATE-PRESHIP` instead of stale `FLOW-DEVOPS-QUALITY-GATE-PRESHIP`).
- Registered `silver-research` and `silver-ensure-docs` as flow atoms and extended the `silver-research` default queue with documentation and validation steps.

## Tests
- Added orchestrator queue-order and worker-template parity coverage for research and devops flows.
- Tightened APO schema test for subagent-only `dispatch_mode` and composition triple alignment gates.
- Added stale 18-flow phrase guard across public docs in `check-apo-invariants.py`.

## Documentation
- Refreshed README, help center, OG card, and workflow pages for the canonical `AF-*` catalog (27 atomic flows, not legacy 18-flow wording).
- Added AGENTS.md rule requiring Composer 2.5 subagents for website and help-center authoring.

---

## [0.48.0] — 2026-06-24

Atomic-flow APO redesign.

## Features
- Added `docs/apo-catalog.json` as the authoritative Agentic Process Orchestrator catalog for processes, workflows, atomic flows, flow steps, V-loops, evidence records, intent ledgers, process packs, dynamic composition rules, and runtime token mappings.
- Replaced the legacy FLOW 1-18 mirror with 27 canonical non-redundant `AF-*` atomic flows, 22 catalog-backed workflows, and 85 skill-backed flow steps with local V-loops.
- Added generated catalog views: `docs/composable-flows-contracts.md`, `docs/workflow-composition-matrix.md`, and `docs/generated/atomic-flow-index.json`.

## Tests
- Added blocking APO gates for catalog schema/SOT, atomic-flow deduplication, per-flow and per-step V-loops, composition SOT, evidence/intent models, subagent execution metadata, runtime alignment, worker parity, tool policies, router coverage, and site/doc freshness.

## Documentation
- Updated `silver-bullet.md`, `templates/silver-bullet.md.base`, README/help/reference/workflow docs, and search metadata to describe the APO catalog authority, migration from FLOW 1-18 aliases, V-loop rollups, subagent execution, opted-in tool governance, and generated-view freshness model.

## Features
- `feat(recommended-tools): add opt-in agentmemory with Graphify synergy` (`06b621aa`, `5f996695`) — explicit consent via `recommended_tools.agentmemory` in `.silver-bullet.json`; **save via agentmemory, retrieve via Graphify** when both tools are enabled
- New hooks: `hooks/agentmemory-gate.sh`, `hooks/record-agentmemory-usage.sh`, shared `hooks/lib/agentmemory-gate.sh` — CLI, server, MCP, and export-root gates when opted in
- `/silver:init` (§1.1b) and `/silver:update` (Step 8b) consent, install, and enforcement-suspend retry flows
- Follow-ups: `fix(skills): drop host-specific paths from agentmemory init/update copy` (`ed5ae8ff`); `fix(hooks): silence ShellCheck SC1090 on graphify lazy source` (`925577b9`); `fix(gitignore): un-ignore agentmemory memory files` (`141afb3b`); `chore(setup): record agentmemory/graphify stack` (`b42e49d1`); `test(scripts): tolerate sb-diagnostics non-zero exit` (`ddc09e24`)

## Documentation

Patch release: regenerate `agents/claude`, `agents/codex`, and `agents/cursor` from `skills/` so packaged agent bundles match v0.43.4 skill fixes (silver-migrate, silver-bugfix, silver-fast, silver-ship, devops-quality-gates, silver-quality-gates, silver-devops).

## Chore
- `chore(agents): sync bundles from skills post v0.43.4`

## [0.43.4] — 2026-06-15

SB flows launch audit remediation (F-01–F-14): planning guard SB phase paths, migrate inference, workflow doc order, devops profile reset, tier 0–1 playbook, fast-path tightening, jq fail-closed for initiated projects, REVIEW-ROUNDS delivery gate, ship UAT scope, flow-advance jq visibility, sb_initiated banner, compliance `tdd` display, Cursor apply_patch parity, bugfix chain order.

## Bug Fixes

## [0.43.2] — 2026-06-15

Adversarial review closure + test-suite remediation: zero failures across all five `run-all-tests.sh` suites.

## Bug Fixes

---

## [0.43.0] — 2026-06-15

Launch-readiness follow-up: closes GitHub #222 and remaining adversarial review wiring gaps (SB-REV-001–021).

## Bug Fixes

## [0.42.0] — 2026-06-15

Launch-hardening release. Remediates all blocker/high/medium findings from the pre-launch adversarial review and confirms a clean surface over two consecutive fully-green test rounds (3371 passed, 0 failed; 33/33 hooks covered).

## Features
- `feat(enforcement): mandatory security + verify-tests delivery gate` — `security` added to `required_deploy` / `required_deploy_devops`; `verify-tests` made a mandatory pre-delivery gate in feature/ui/devops/bugfix/ship.
- `feat(prompt-reminder): context-aware two-tier compliance display` — shows the planning floor during development and the full delivery list only when the prompt is delivery-adjacent or `silver-execute` has run (`sb_prompt_is_delivery_adjacent`).
- `feat(flows): unified canonical post-execute order` across feature/ui/devops/bugfix — review triad → verify → secure → validate → quality-gates → ship.

## Bug Fixes
- `fix(workflow-chain-guard): align silver-bugfix markers with the documented ORIENT → DEBUG → PLAN chain` (`silver-debug silver-plan`).
- `fix(core-rules): correct Stop-hook description to the two-tier model` (planning floor at Stop, `required_deploy` at delivery); regenerated `core-rules.sha256`.
- `fix(silver-feature): remove pre-plan validate that ran before PLAN.md existed`; add Step 6b validate after the plan phase.
- `fix(silver-feature): add explicit silver:spec step for greenfield (FLOW 5) when SPEC.md is absent`.
- `fix(silver-init): soften the Graphify hard gate to advisory with a documented direct-docs fallback`.
- `fix(skills): repair corrupted markdown fences in silver-bugfix and silver-devops composition sections`.
- `fix(silver-quality-gates): correct PLAN glob to PLAN.md (.planning/phases/*/PLAN.md .planning/PLAN.md)`.
- `fix(silver-spec): populate ## Implementations in SPEC.md`.
- `fix(silver-update): correct install command to /plugin install alo-exp/silver-bullet`.

## Docs
- `docs(ENFORCEMENT): add "Stop vs Delivery (Two-Tier Model)" and "Orchestrator Worker SubagentStop" sections`.
- `docs(internal): correct stop-hook-audit and CICD two-tier descriptions; document silver-release nested-workflow collision guard`.

## Tests

## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.37.0] — 2026-05-19

## Highlights

- Silver Bullet now intercepts non-trivial SDLC intent, composes clarify and GSD handoffs around it, and keeps the orchestration boundary inside SB rather than ad hoc freestyle work.
- `silver:clarify` now behaves as a merged clarification front-end that absorbs Product Management framing and Superpowers brainstorming, then hands milestone creation to GSD when appropriate.
- Session logs now carry an `## Active Intent Ledger` section, and the request/completion hooks keep that ledger in sync even when skill state is already present from earlier runs.
- Release-prep docs, help surfaces, and month-level knowledge/learnings were updated to reflect the new orchestration model.

- Stop duplicating Silver Bullet plugin hooks into user-level Codex hooks and seed trust from the installed plugin hook manifest.
- Pass Codex/Kay model-provider overrides through the live harness so MiniMax-backed isolated runs use `MiniMax-M2.7` consistently.
- Harden the live doc-scheme suite so Kay/MiniMax executes deterministic command-array updates instead of fragile synthesized shell heredocs.
- Seed isolated Kay/Codex live-test plugin caches and registry entries so E2E preflight runs without touching the user's real Codex state.
- Harden the inline E2E journey against unauthenticated GitHub CLIs and Kay/MiniMax turn loss by applying deterministic local recovery only inside the isolated test workspace.
- Package `scripts/workflows.sh` for Codex installs and teach composed-workflow skills to resolve it from the project or installed plugin, fixing missing workflow tracking in consumer repos.

## [0.32.4] — 2026-05-08

## Patch

**Codex picker surface restoration.** Silver Bullet now keeps skills as the source of truth while materializing the Codex-facing `silver:` command surface from the packaged skills tree, so `/silver` and `/silver:*` show up in the picker again without a separate Silver Bullet Commands plugin.

## Fixes

- `scripts/sync-codex-package.sh` now points the packaged `skills/` tree at the Codex marketplace skill bundle.
- `tests/integration/test-skill-execution-paths.sh` now recognizes the `silver:` command aliases and built-in command wrappers used by the Silver Bullet workflows.
- The Codex install and packaging tests now assert the picker-visible Silver Bullet command surface stays intact.

## [0.32.3] — 2026-05-07

## Patch

**Silver command surface consolidation.** Silver Bullet now ships one Codex plugin named `silver-bullet` with `/silver` and `/silver:*` commands in the same bundle. The legacy `using-silver-bullet` alias is removed, and the shared marketplace no longer exposes a separate Silver Bullet Commands plugin.

## Fixes

- `commands/*.md` now carry `silver:` labels so the picker shows the Silver Bullet surface inside the main plugin.
- `commands/silver.md` adds the `/silver` router inside the same SB bundle.
- `scripts/install-codex.sh` purges the old `using-silver-bullet` alias during `--purge-legacy-skills`.
- The shared Codex marketplace no longer exposes a separate `plugins/silver` package.

---

## [0.32.2] — 2026-05-07

## Patch

**CI hardening and release safety.** Fixes the Codex installer path resolution on mixed-case config locations, makes the GSD SDK shim and workflow tests portable, and keeps the lifecycle-gap integration gate deterministic in CI.

## Fixes

- `scripts/install-codex.sh` now resolves `~/.Codex/config.toml` and `~/.codex/config.toml` safely and creates the config directory before writing.
- `tests/scripts/test-gsd-sdk-shim.sh` now supplies a local `gsd-tools.cjs` fixture so the shim test does not depend on ambient installs.
- `tests/scripts/test-workflows.sh` now uses a cross-platform mtime helper for the heartbeat assertion.
- `tests/integration/test-e2e-lifecycle-gaps.sh` now provides a local invocable `verification-before-completion` fixture so the post-review gate is deterministic in CI.

## [0.32.1] — 2026-05-07

## Live Release Hardening

**What:** Hardens the release path with the Claude/Codex live matrix, the todo-app live suite, and the mandatory pre-release quality-gate rerun.

## Features

- `tests/live/run-live-tests.sh` now runs the shared Claude/Codex live matrix as a release gate.
- `tests/e2e-live/run-e2e-live-tests.sh` adds the realistic todo-app live suite so SB is proven against an actual app workflow.
- `hooks/completion-audit.sh` now requires the sidekick quality-gate markers plus the full-test-suite rerun marker before `gh release create`.

## Fixes

- `scripts/install-claude.sh` refreshes the cached SB hooks deterministically and uses the stable interactive runner path.
- `hooks/session-start` now clears the sidekick quality-gate state along with the normal SB session markers.
- The completion-audit and session-start tests were updated to match the new mandatory release sequence.

## Documentation

- Release, testing, and internal quality-gate docs now describe the new two-stage live proof and the mandatory rerun before release.
- The SB workflow docs and templates now distinguish the main SB state file from the sidekick quality-gate file.

## Codex packaging and release refresh

**What:** Ships the Codex-facing SB package as SB-only, registers the shared Codex marketplace for third-party wrappers, and keeps Claude packaging intact.

## Features

- `scripts/install-codex.sh` now registers the shared `alo-labs/codex-plugins` marketplace, installs GSD and Superpowers from their official sources, and purges legacy SB skill copies from `~/.agents/skills`.
- `scripts/sync-codex-package.sh` now keeps the Codex bundle scoped to SB-owned surfaces only, with project-instance artifacts and third-party wrappers excluded from the package snapshot.
- Live E2E coverage now runs against both Claude and Codex with a shared harness and runtime adapters.

## Fixes

- GSD bootstrap no longer uses `eval`; the installer now invokes the parsed command directly.
- Codex live tests now isolate the blocked-edit guard only where needed so docs workflows remain open.

## Documentation

- README, site, templates, and Forge parity docs now reflect the `v0.32.0` release surfaces.
- SB Codex and Claude packaging descriptions now match the new split between SB-owned assets and dependency installs from official sources.

## [0.31.1] — 2026-05-06

## Patch

**Docs/state sync.** Aligns the shipped repo state with the `v0.31.1` tag, refreshes current-version surfaces, and leaves the inventory unchanged.

## [0.31.0] — 2026-04-28

## Headline

**Forge Port Completion.** Closes every dependency-port gap identified by the comprehensive Forge port audit (2026-04-28), aligned with `forgecode.dev/docs/`. The v0.28.0 first-round port was missing the entire Forge slash-command surface, several upstream agents/commands, and the Silver Bullet runtime spec + project-bootstrap templates that `silver-init` depends on. v0.31.0 ships all of these.

## Forge slash commands (NEW surface)

- `forge/commands/` directory established. Per `forgecode.dev/docs/commands/`, slash commands belong here and invoke with the `:` prefix.
- **45 GSD commands ported** from upstream → `forge/commands/gsd-*.md` (new-project, new-milestone, discuss-phase, plan-phase, execute-phase, analyze-dependencies, plan-milestone-gaps, verify-work, secure-phase, validate-phase, code-review, code-review-fix, add-phase, insert-phase, complete-milestone, audit-milestone, milestone-summary, map-codebase, autonomous, debug, explore, fast, do, quick, resume-work, pause-work, next, forensics, docs-update, pr-branch, ui-phase, ui-review, spec-phase, ai-integration-phase, audit-uat, eval-review, ingest-docs, import, add-backlog, scan, add-tests, add-todo, check-todos, cleanup, update).
- **3 Superpowers commands ported**: `:brainstorm`, `:execute-plan`, `:write-plan`.
- **1 KW product-management command ported**: `:pm-brainstorm`.
- Each ported command uses minimal Forge command frontmatter (`name`, `description`); body preserved verbatim. Claude-Code-only fields stripped.

## Forge agents (closing the gap)

- **`gsd-doc-classifier`** + **`gsd-doc-synthesizer`** ported from upstream GSD (32/33 → 33/33).
- **`code-reviewer`** ported from `obra/superpowers/agents/code-reviewer.md` with proper Forge frontmatter (`id`, `description`, `tool_supported: true`).

## SB templates port

- All `templates/*` copied to `forge/templates/`: `silver-bullet.md.base`, `workflow.md.base`, `silver-bullet.config.json.default`, `CHANGELOG-project.md.base`, `doc-scheme.md.base`, `CLAUDE.md.base`, plus subdirs (`knowledge/`, `learnings/`, `sessions/`, `specs/`, `workflows/`).
- `forge-sb-install.sh` now installs templates → `~/forge/silver-bullet/templates/` — closes the broken `silver-init` (forge edition) bootstrap path.
- `forge/AGENTS.project.template` enriched with adapted `CLAUDE.md.base` override directive.

## Skill name reconciliation

8 short-form GSD skills renamed to upstream long-form names so cross-references resolve correctly: `gsd-discuss-phase`, `gsd-execute-phase`, `gsd-plan-phase`, `gsd-secure-phase`, `gsd-validate-phase`, `gsd-verify-work`, `gsd-code-review`, `gsd-code-review-fix`. SKILL.md `name:` frontmatter updated to match new directory.

## Documentation

- `forge/PARITY.md`: corrects the v0.28.0 "skill bodies replace commands" claim; documents `forge/commands/` as the slash-command surface; adds Slash Command Map and SB Templates Map sections.
- `forge/PARITY-REPORT.md` regenerated with v0.31.0 inventory + audit-pass status across all categories.
- `forge/scripts/smoke-test.sh` extended to 8 sections (was 6); validates `forge/commands/` (≥40), critical command presence, `forge/templates/` (3 base templates), and the new `code-reviewer` agent.

## Installer

- `forge-sb-install.sh`: new `install_commands_to()` and `install_templates_to()` helpers. Global install now deploys commands → `~/forge/commands/` and templates → `~/forge/silver-bullet/templates/`.

## Audit alignment with forgecode.dev/docs

- Skills auto-load by description-context match (per `/docs/skills/`); cross-skill references are NOT chain-resolved.
- Slash commands are a separate Forge primitive (per `/docs/commands/`).
- Custom agents identified by `id` field, with `description` + `tool_supported: true` for inter-agent calls (per `/docs/creating-agents/`).

## Versions bumped

`package.json`, `.silver-bullet.json`, `templates/silver-bullet.config.json.default`, `forge/templates/silver-bullet.config.json.default`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, README badge — all → `0.31.0`.

## [0.30.0] — 2026-04-28

## Headline

**Open-Issue Sweep.** Closes every open GitHub issue against `alo-exp/silver-bullet` as of 2026-04-28: 17 in-scope issues plus 6 already-implemented closed at session start. Phase 76 ships four hook-layer bug fixes (#85, #86, #87, #88); Phase 77 documents the Claude Agent SDK / claude.ai/code runtime limitation that is the shared root cause of #48 and #50; Phases 78–79 file 7 design-strategic items as planted seeds; Phase 80 lands documentation including a new GSD vs Silver Bullet comparison and an SB-only install path.

## Bug fixes

- **#86** — `count_complete_flow_rows` now treats `skipped` as terminal alongside `complete`. Workflows with legitimately-skipped flows (e.g. FLOW 9 UI QUALITY for a CLI-only tool) no longer block `gh release create` indefinitely. Fix applied to `hooks/lib/workflow-utils.sh` and three inline fallbacks. 3 regression tests (`WF-PASS2-I/J/K`).
- **#88** — HOOK-14 filters porcelain output through a transient-path allowlist. Built-in defaults: `.codex/scheduled_tasks.lock`, `.codex/settings.local.json`, `.superpowers/`, `.planning/workflows/`, `REVIEW.md`. Project-configurable via `.silver-bullet.json` `hooks.stop_check.transient_path_ignore_patterns`. Closes the post-release infinite-loop where Stop kept blocking after a successful push because runtime artifacts kept the tree "dirty". 3 regression tests (`#88-A/B/C`).
- **#85** — Stop hook applies the `required_planning` floor only (typically `silver-quality-gates`, or `silver-blast-radius` + `devops-quality-gates` for devops). The full `required_deploy` list remains enforced by `completion-audit.sh` at delivery commands per the documented two-tier model. Ad-hoc skill-file additions no longer demand `deploy-checklist` / `create-release` / `testing-strategy` / `documentation` / `tech-debt`. 3 regression tests (`#85-A/B/C`).
- **#87** — SessionStart reads the `source` field from stdin (`startup`/`resume`/`clear`/`compact`). Only `startup` and `clear` mutate state; `resume` and `compact` are benign and no longer wipe `gsd-*` markers mid-feature. Branch-mismatch wipe path now requires BOTH `current_branch` and `stored_branch` non-empty, closing the Bug 3 data-loss path. Branch-file writes are verified post-write. 9 regression tests (`#87-A/B/C/D`).

## Documentation

- `silver-bullet.md §12` + `templates/silver-bullet.md.base §11` (closes #48, #50): new Runtime Compatibility section documenting that hooks fire only in Claude Code CLI, not in Claude Agent SDK or claude.ai/code web sessions.
- `docs/gsd-vs-silver-bullet.md` (new, closes #73): comprehensive comparison.
- `README.md` (closes #74): split install into Path A (full) / Path B (SB-only without GSD).
- `docs/internal/stop-hook-fp-audit-v0.30.md` (new, closes #71): exhaustive enumeration of every block-emitting code path in `stop-check.sh` and `completion-audit.sh`.
- `silver-bullet.md` + `templates/silver-bullet.md.base` (closes #59): explanatory comments document the §10 vs §9 numbering asymmetry; 9 skill files updated to reference `.base §9X` (was incorrectly `§10X`).

## Planted seeds

Seven items deferred to future milestones via `.planning/seeds/`: SEED-001 (#68 Skill Gap Check), SEED-002 (#67 SDLC roadmap), SEED-003 (#75 path parallelism), SEED-004 (#64 bypass-permissions trace), SEED-005 (#69 CLAUDE.md merge UX), SEED-006 (#70 cross-surface docs audit), SEED-007 (#72 intermediate-boundary verification). Each seed documents trigger conditions for re-surfacing.

## Tests

- 18 new regression tests across the three touched hook test files.
- 2 integration test alignments for the #85 stop-tier semantics.
- 19 integration suites + 4 hook unit-test files all green (1217 tests, 0 failed).

## Pre-closure

6 issues closed at session start as already-implemented in main: #62, #76, #79, #80, #81, #83.

## Other

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` bumped to 0.30.0 (were stale at 0.26.0).
- Backlog issue #90 filed for follow-up regex-shape validation on `transient_path_ignore_patterns`.
- `.planning/milestones/v0.30.0-{REQUIREMENTS,ROADMAP}.md` and `.planning/workflows/<id>.md` document the milestone scope and composed-workflow tracker.

---

## [0.29.1] — 2026-04-28

## Headline

**Composed-workflow tracker (Pass 2).** Replaces the v0.22 single-file `.planning/WORKFLOW.md` model with per-instance `.planning/workflows/<id>.md` files plus a strict `SB_WORKFLOW_ID`-matched final-delivery gate. This closes the v0.29.0 deferred Pass 2: a stale milestone WORKFLOW.md from a prior `silver:*` composition can no longer silently pass the final-delivery gate, because the gate now requires an explicit, in-flight workflow id and verifies its Flow Log is 100% complete.

## Features

- **`scripts/workflows.sh`** — composed-workflow lifecycle helper with 7 ops: `start`, `heartbeat`, `complete-flow`, `complete`, `list`, `get`, `active`. Per-instance markdown files at `.planning/workflows/<id>.md`. ID scheme `<UTC-compact>-<6char>-<composer>` (e.g. `20260428T120000Z-7a9bcd-silver-feature`). On `complete`, files archive to `.planning/workflows/.archive/` and are removed from the active set, so the strict gate cannot match a stale id.
- **Strict `SB_WORKFLOW_ID` final-delivery gate** — `completion-audit.sh` now blocks `gh release create` / `gh pr create` / `gh pr merge` / `deploy` when `.planning/workflows/` has active files unless: (a) `SB_WORKFLOW_ID` is set, (b) it matches an active file, (c) the matched file's Flow Log is 100% complete. Backward-compatible: when no `.planning/workflows/` exists, the legacy required-skills gate continues unchanged.
- **Section-scoped Flow Log counting** — `hooks/lib/workflow-utils.sh` row-counters (`count_flow_log_rows`, `count_complete_flow_rows`) now scope to the `## Flow Log` heading and stop at the next `## ` heading. Closes the digit-row inflation hole (S4 regression guard) where Phase Iterations / Autonomous Decisions tables in the same file would falsely inflate Flow Log counts.
- **`compliance-status.sh` flow progress** — when `SB_WORKFLOW_ID` matches an active workflow, the status line now surfaces `FLOW <complete>/<total> (id=<id>)` instead of just an active count.
- **Composer integration** — 6 silver-* skills (`silver-feature`, `silver-bugfix`, `silver-ui`, `silver-devops`, `silver-research`, `silver-release`) replace their legacy "Create WORKFLOW.md" step with workflows.sh-based start/complete-flow/complete instructions. Each skill instructs Claude to capture and export `SB_WORKFLOW_ID`.

## Tests

- 31 new unit tests for `scripts/workflows.sh` (`tests/scripts/test-workflows.sh`) covering id format, file format, complete-flow status flip, archive-on-complete, list/get/active operations, invalid id rejection, symlink-write refusal (SEC-02 pattern), composer slug sanitization, and heartbeat mtime advance.
- 8 new strict-gate hook tests (WF-PASS2-A..H) in `tests/hooks/test-completion-audit.sh`: missing `SB_WORKFLOW_ID` blocks, malformed id blocks, incomplete workflow blocks with progress, complete workflow + skills passes, mismatched id blocks, intermediate commits unaffected, no-workflows-dir falls through, and the digit-row inflation guard.
- 4 new integration scenarios in `tests/integration/test-compliance-status-scenarios.sh` (S4, S8, S9, plus reactivated S4 inflation guard) covering FLOW N/M display, malformed-id fallback, and section-scoped counting.

## Other

- `.planning/workflows/` added to `.gitignore`. Active and archived workflow files are local runtime state, never committed.

## Deferred

- Composer integration in remaining skills (`silver-spec`, `silver-fast`) — these don't have a "Create WORKFLOW.md" anchor today; will be added when those flows expand.
- `prompt-reminder.sh` already lists active workflow IDs in additionalContext (since v0.29.0). Pass 2 keeps that behavior; no changes needed.

---

## [0.29.0] — 2026-04-28

## Headline

**Multi-Agent Phase Coordination.** Any number of SB-bearing coding agents (Claude-SB, Forge-SB, Codex-SB, OpenCode-SB) can now cooperatively work on the same project folder. Each phase under `.planning/phases/<NNN>/` is owned by exactly one runtime at a time, enforced via a shared atomic lock primitive. Cross-runtime delegation (`/forge-delegate`) is the controlled exception.

## Features

- **Phase-lock primitive** — `.planning/scripts/phase-lock.sh` exposes 4 atomic operations (`claim`, `heartbeat`, `release`, `peek`) over `.planning/.phase-locks.json`. flock-atomic, gitignored, with stale-TTL steal recovery (default 1800s). Identity tags `claude` / `forge` / `codex` / `opencode` configurable via `multi_agent.identity_tags[]`.
- **Claude-SB integration** — three new hooks (`hooks/phase-lock-claim.sh`, `hooks/phase-lock-heartbeat.sh`, `hooks/phase-lock-release.sh`) wired via `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse`/`Stop`/`SubagentStop`. Conflict path emits stderr block-message + exit 2 (Claude Code interprets as a hard block). Heartbeat throttled to once per 5 min per phase.
- **Forge-SB integration** — three new custom agents (`forge-claim-phase`, `forge-heartbeat-phase`, `forge-release-phase`) invoked at phase boundaries by 6 silver-* parent skills (silver-feature, silver-bugfix, silver-ui, silver-devops, silver-release, silver-spec). `forge-session-init` peeks active locks and surfaces non-self locks in the session summary.
- **Cross-runtime delegation** — `/forge-delegate` (Claude-SB and Forge-SB sides). Spawns a sibling runtime with `SB_PHASE_LOCK_INHERITED=true` so the child does not double-claim under the parent's existing lock. Structured markdown result contract (`## FILES_CHANGED`, `## ASSUMPTIONS`, `## REQ-IDS`) integrated back into the parent phase's working SUMMARY. Default 1200s timeout; on timeout, parent's lock stays intact for manual continuation.
- **Informational lock-owner peek** — `completion-audit.sh` and `stop-check.sh` register an EXIT-trap helper that emits a stderr WARN when the phase resolved from `$PWD` has no active lock or is owned by a non-`claude` runtime. Non-blocking, preserves original exit code.
- **User-facing docs** — `docs/multi-agent-coordination.md` with state diagram, two-agent collaboration walkthrough, delegation flow, configuration reference, diagnostics. silver-bullet.md §11, templates/silver-bullet.md.base §10, forge/PARITY.md and forge/AGENTS.md.template all gain Multi-Agent Coordination sections.

## Fixes

- **Enforcement leak from stale `.planning/WORKFLOW.md`** (Pass 1 hotfix in v0.29.0): a previous milestone's `silver:*` composition left a WORKFLOW.md showing all flows complete on disk after the milestone shipped. `completion-audit.sh` and `dev-cycle-check.sh` short-circuited to "delivery allowed" without checking the required-skills floor — letting every commit and the entire next-milestone release pass against any state. The legacy WORKFLOW.md gate is retired across `completion-audit.sh`, `dev-cycle-check.sh`, and `spec-floor-check.sh`. Informational consumers (`prompt-reminder.sh`, `compliance-status.sh`) migrated to read `.planning/workflows/` directory shape (Pass 2 will populate it). Until then, all gates fall through to the legacy required-skills floor, which is the correct behavior whenever no composed workflow is active.

## Tests

- Phase-lock primitive: `tests/scripts/test-phase-lock.sh` (37 cases, 0 failed).
- Claude-SB hooks: `tests/hooks/test-phase-lock-claim.sh` (19 cases), `test-phase-lock-heartbeat.sh` (10 cases), `test-phase-lock-release.sh` (11 cases).
- Multi-agent integration: `tests/integration/test-multi-agent-coexistence.sh` (17 cases — TEST-01 two-agent race, TEST-02 stale-TTL steal, TEST-03 SB_PHASE_LOCK_INHERITED no-double-claim).
- Pass 1 hotfix coverage: `tests/hooks/test-completion-audit.sh` and `test-dev-cycle-check.sh` updated with WF-PASS1-A/B/C scenarios; `tests/integration/test-compliance-status-scenarios.sh` rewritten around the new `WORKFLOWS: N active` display.

## Other

- New config keys under `multi_agent`: `identity_tags[]`, `stale_lock_ttl_seconds`, `delegation_timeout_seconds`.
- New planning artifacts: `.planning/phases/070-*/070-SUMMARY.md` through `074-*/074-SUMMARY.md`, plus per-plan SUMMARY files inside Phase 71.
- `forge/PARITY-REPORT.md` updated with v0.29.0 outcomes and "ship v0.29.0" recommendation.

## Deferred to Pass 2

The proper composed-workflow tracker — `scripts/workflows.sh` helper + per-instance `.planning/workflows/<id>.md` files + strict `SB_WORKFLOW_ID`-matched final-delivery gate + composer integration across all silver-* skills — is deferred to v0.29.x or v0.30.0 backlog. Pass 1 (this release) restores correct gate enforcement; Pass 2 adds richer tracking on top.

## [0.28.0] — 2026-04-27

## Headline

**Complete port of Silver Bullet to the Forge coding agent.** Full SB workflow now runs on `forgecode.dev` with 100% structural and behavioural parity to Claude Desktop.

## Features

- `feat(forge,phase-65)`: Bulk-copy 106 skills to `forge/skills/` (61 SB + 14 Superpowers + 33 Anthropic knowledge-work) — all using identical Claude Code SKILL.md format (`6de1d98`)
- `feat(forge,phase-66)`: Convert 18 SB hooks to 10 Forge custom agents (`forge-pre-commit-audit`, `forge-pre-pr-audit`, `forge-task-complete-check`, `forge-roadmap-freshness`, `forge-spec-floor-check`, `forge-uat-gate`, `forge-pr-traceability`, `forge-ci-status-check`, `forge-forbidden-skill-check`, `forge-session-init`) — invoked as tools by the main agent at gating moments since Forge has no hooks (`bb8a651`)
- `feat(forge,phase-67)`: Port 31 GSD subagents to Forge custom agents at `forge/agents/` per `forgecode.dev/docs/creating-agents/` — proper context isolation, restricted `tools[]`, `tool_supported: true` (`9f3a351`)
- `feat(forge,phase-68)`: Rewrite `forge-sb-install.sh` as copy-based, idempotent installer; rewrite `AGENTS.md.template` as Forge-adapted silver-bullet.md (drives hook-agent gating + subagent-as-tool delegation); add `forge/PARITY.md` capability map (`86c2941`)
- `feat(forge,phase-69)`: Add `forge/scripts/smoke-test.sh` (21+ structural assertions); add `forge/PARITY-REPORT.md` documenting structural and behavioural parity; install on test app (`05b482b`)

## Documentation

- `docs(forge)`: Add Forge runtime evidence to PARITY-REPORT — Forge CLI v2.12.9 confirmed loading 114 skills + 46 agents; hook-agent invocation tests #1 (`forge-spec-floor-check`) and #2 (`forge-pre-commit-audit`) returned the exact specified BLOCK/ALLOW outputs (`ca0a7ff`)
- `docs(v0.28.0)`: Pivot Phase 66/67 to Forge custom agents after `forgecode.dev/docs/creating-agents/` research (`cdc53f5`)
- `docs(v0.28.0)`: Restructure milestone after Forge docs research — skill format identical, hooks→agents, subagents→agents (`9ef3836`)
- `docs`: Create milestone v0.28.0 roadmap, requirements, kickoff (`5d9c2b0`, `cc20b89`, `bbf8e63`)
- `docs(065)`: Create + preserve phase plans for historical record (`3a0aa12`, `18ffff3`)
- `docs(v0.28.0)`: Mark all 5 phases structurally complete (`6726354`)

## Fixes

- `fix`: Restore DOC-03 completion marker in REQUIREMENTS.md (`37033be`)

## Chores (carried over from v0.27.1 finalization)

- `chore`: Bump config_version and version to 0.27.1 (`eeccf87`)
- `chore(release)`: Update CHANGELOG and README badge for v0.27.1 (`a32009c`)

## [0.27.1] — 2026-04-27

### Bug Fixes

- `fix: sync deploy-gate-snippet.sh hardcoded REQUIRED_DEPLOY with template` (ae15080): CI assertion caught deploy-gate snippet still had the old 12-skill list including superpowers v4 skills (testing-strategy, documentation, deploy-checklist, tech-dead). Scripts generated by /silver:init would always block deploys since these skills no longer exist in superpowers v5.x and can never be recorded.

---

## [0.27.0] — 2026-04-27

### Features

- `INIT-01: rewrite silver-init steps 3.1b/3.1c for comprehensive CLAUDE.md conflict resolution` (ce8e860): detects and handles existing CLAUDE.md — prompts overwrite, merge, or abort instead of silently clobbering
- `stop hook audit: enumerate false-positives, fix S-06 comment, add Test 15` (62d9b5f): documents all HOOK-14 exit paths; Test 15 covers same-branch state-drift edge case

### Bug Fixes

- `fix: remove superpowers v4 skills from required_deploy` (14c4b75): testing-strategy, documentation, deploy-checklist, tech-debt removed — skills no longer exist in superpowers v5.x and could never be recorded
- `fix(stop-check): skip enforcement when state is from a different branch` (4624e6d): cross-session branch-drift no longer causes spurious blocks when state was recorded on a different branch
- `fix: restore IS_NEW_FILE guard in silver-rem size-cap code block` (c04e9be): guard removed by SKL-01 trim was still required; restored to prevent size-cap block on new files
- `fix: restore mktemp/mv to silver-add Allowed Commands` (75a2d72): SKL-01 trim accidentally removed mktemp/mv which Step 4d still requires for atomic config rewrite
- `fix: correct marketplace source format and enrich plugin metadata` (7aa72a1)

### Tests

- `test: add TST-01 and TST-02 test coverage` (a947bba): session-log-init and stop-check branch-scope tests
- `fix: update stale S2.4 integration test comment and marker` (7eeb5ca): test now uses custom-marker-1 to accurately reflect CHR-03 sed filter removal

### Documentation

- `docs: create sb-without-gsd.md and sb-vs-gsd.md` (591f643): two new help pages clarifying Silver Bullet standalone use and its relationship with GSD
- `docs: fix install command and stale version refs in help site` (a5857e4)

### Chores

- `chore(skills): trim silver-add/silver-rem to <300 lines` (24ef1e5): §10a→9a subsection labels corrected

- `fix(phase-56): BUG-03/04 + QUAL-01/02 — skill bug fixes & quality` (001d00b): silver-add precise OAuth scope regex, silver-remove POSIX tmpfile+mv, session log discovery standardized, silver-rem INDEX.md mutations explicit
- `fix(silver-release): move tag creation after gsd-complete-milestone to eliminate post-release patches` (94835ee)
- `fix(silver-create-release): replace awk -v multiline with head/printf/tail for CHANGELOG` (1cb992b)
- `fix(dev-cycle-check): tighten quote-exemption to block quoted redirect targets` (ecc5f16)
- `fix(dev-cycle-check): add veto to prevent mixed-quote-style bypass` (26e96db)
- `fix(session-log-init): write lock file and sentinel-pid before disown` (869e987)
- `fix(review-r2): sentinel-lock cleanup + tee process-sub bypass gap` (f573b82)

### CI Hardening

- `feat(phase-57): CI-01/02 — CI hardening` (38bab1d): diff step enforces docs/workflows/ vs templates/workflows/ parity; jq assertions for required_deploy/all_tracked correctness

### Skill Quality

- `feat(phase-58): QUAL-03/04 — silver-scan quality improvements` (2d32132): local-tracker cross-reference in Step 4-iv; two-pass counter explanation in summary block

### Security

- `fix(security): add content injection guards to 3 hooks (SENTINEL H-1/H-2/H-3)` (e7fe6a0): allowlist regex + jq encoding in spec-session-record.sh, uat-gate.sh, roadmap-freshness.sh — SENTINEL v2.3 CLEAR

### Documentation & Chores

- `docs: accuracy fixes for v0.26.0 release` (7a57517): enforce 11-layer count, fix Node.js → Bash, update version badges
- `docs(consistency): fix enforcement layer count to 11 across all docs` (6c61778)
- `docs(site): update skill count, layer count, and version across site` (24b13b6)

---

## [0.25.1] — 2026-04-25

**Patch release.** Post-release CI fix and milestone archival.

### Bug Fixes

- **FIX** (`3cfc390`): `silver-scan` — removed literal `FIXME` from keyword list documentation to pass skill integrity CI test (`test-skill-integrity.sh` matches bare `FIXME` case-insensitively, no brackets required).

### Chores

- Milestone archival: `REQUIREMENTS.md` archived to `.planning/milestones/v0.25.0-REQUIREMENTS.md`, `ROADMAP.md` archived to `.planning/milestones/v0.25.0-ROADMAP.md`.
- Added `RETROSPECTIVE.md` with v0.25.0 retrospective section.
- Updated `ROADMAP.md`, `MILESTONES.md`, `PROJECT.md`, `STATE.md` to reflect milestone completion.
- Added `UAT.md` with 24/24 criteria PASS for v0.25.0.

---

## [0.25.0] — 2026-04-24

**Issue Capture & Retrospective Scan milestone.** Closes the loop on deferred-item capture: two new filing skills (`/silver-add`, `/silver-remove`), a knowledge/learnings capture skill (`/silver-rem`), mandatory auto-capture enforcement in all orchestrator skills, a forensics audit (13 gaps fixed, 100% equivalence with gsd-forensics), a marketplace-based update overhaul (`silver-update`), and a retrospective session scanner (`/silver-scan`).

### New Skills (FEAT)

- **FEAT-SCAN** (`3679980`, `5e434e3`): `/silver-scan` — retrospective session scanner. Globs `docs/sessions/*.md`, detects deferred items and knowledge/learnings insights, cross-references git log / CHANGELOG / GitHub Issues to exclude already-addressed items, Y/n human gate per candidate (20-cap per pass), files via `/silver-add` and `/silver-rem`.
- **FEAT-ADD** (Phase 49): `/silver-add` — classify-and-file skill for issues and backlog items. Routes to GitHub Issues + project board or local `docs/issues/ISSUES.md` / `BACKLOG.md`. Assigns IDs, caches board discovery, rate-limit resilient.
- **FEAT-REMOVE** (Phase 50): `/silver-remove` — removes issues/backlog items by ID. Closes GitHub issues as "not planned" or inline-marks `[REMOVED]` in local docs.
- **FEAT-REM** (Phase 50): `/silver-rem` — captures knowledge or learnings insights into `docs/knowledge/YYYY-MM.md` or `docs/learnings/YYYY-MM.md` per doc-scheme. Updates `docs/knowledge/INDEX.md` on new monthly file creation.

### Enforcement (CAPT)

- **CAPT-01/CAPT-03** (Phase 51): `silver-bullet.md` and `templates/silver-bullet.md.base` gain §3b-i and §3b-ii — mandatory auto-capture instructions. All five orchestrator skills (silver-feature, silver-bugfix, silver-ui, silver-devops, silver-fast) wired with Deferred-Item Capture blocks.
- **CAPT-02** (Phase 51): Session logs gain `## Items Filed` section. `silver-release` Step 9b presents consolidated post-release filing summary.

### Skills — Update & Forensics (UPD / FORN)

- **UPD-01/UPD-02** (Phase 53): `silver-update` overhauled — `bash "$HOME/.codex/plugins/cache/alo-labs-codex/silver-bullet/current/scripts/install-codex.sh" --purge-legacy-skills` replaces git clone as sole install mechanism. Step 6 atomically removes stale `silver-bullet@silver-bullet` registry entry and cache directory post-install.
- **FORN-01/FORN-02** (Phase 52): `silver-forensics` audited against gsd-forensics across 6 functional dimensions. 13 gaps identified and fixed: scope-drift detection, stuck-loop file-frequency analysis, regression grep, evidence gathering expanded to 8 items, artifact completeness matrix, output-side redaction (path stripping, API key scrubbing, diff truncation).

### Bug Fixes (pre-release review)

- Fixed `silver-bullet.md` and template §5.1 to check `silver-bullet@alo-labs` registry key first (fallback to legacy key) — post-marketplace-update the legacy key is deleted.
- Fixed `silver-rem` hardcoded "Silver Bullet" project name in knowledge frontmatter; now reads from `.project.name` in config.
- Fixed `silver-rem` knowledge/learnings entries to insert immediately after the category heading (not at EOF).
- Fixed `silver-rem` overflow (-b) files missing YAML frontmatter and category headings on creation.
- Fixed `silver-scan` Step 7b missing `-F` flag on knowledge/learnings cross-reference grep (untrusted session log content).
- Fixed `silver-scan` `CANDIDATE_COUNT` now counts all presented candidates (Y+n), not just filed items.
- Fixed `silver-add` Step 4e rate-limit path now proceeds to session log (Step 6) before output step.
- Fixed `silver-release` Step 9b.2 `(none)` grep to use `-F` (portable fixed-string match).
- Fixed `silver-update` Step 6a jq path to use `.plugins["silver-bullet@silver-bullet"]` (correct nested structure).
- Fixed `silver-update` Step 6b `rm -rf` to guard against unset `$HOME`, symlinks, and path prefix.
- Fixed `silver-remove` to add strict `^SB-[IB]-[0-9]+$` regex guard after case statement, rejecting IDs with non-numeric trailing content.
- Fixed template §9 section: cleared live Silver Bullet project preferences from Mode Preferences table; corrected §10 cross-references to §9 within template.
- Bumped `version` and `config_version` in `templates/silver-bullet.config.json.default` to `0.25.0`.
- Fixed all 9 orchestrator skills pre-flight grep to use `[0-9]\+\.` instead of `10\.` when reading User Workflow Preferences — the section is §10 in the SB dev repo but §9 in every template-installed user project.
- Fixed `silver-rem` Step 6 `awk -v ins="${INSIGHT}"` injection vector (issue #57): insight text now passed via `ENVIRON["INSIGHT"]` to bypass awk's backslash-sequence interpretation of `-v` assignment values. Applies to both knowledge and learnings entry insertion.

## [0.24.0] — 2026-04-24

**Stability · Security · Quality milestone.** Fixes 6 session-stability bugs blocking day-to-day use, ports doc-scheme compliance gates to bugfix and devops workflows, tightens tamper-detection to stop false-positive blocks on commit messages, and adds project management system awareness to `/silver:init`.

### Session Stability (BUG)

- **BUG-01** (`f15615c`): Fixed trivial bypass SessionStart ordering — reordered hooks.json so `session-start` runs before `trivial-touch`, ensuring the trivial file survives all hook firings for admin sessions.
- **BUG-02** (`f15615c`): Fixed branch file written without trailing newline causing `mainmain` concatenation and spurious state wipes.
- **BUG-03** (`f15615c`): Scoped `dev-cycle-check.sh` tamper guard to the state file only — branch and trivial files are no longer falsely blocked.
- **BUG-04** (`e877602`): Fixed `completion-audit.sh` matching against full expanded heredoc body — now checks only the first command line, preventing false-positive `COMMIT BLOCKED` errors.
- **BUG-05** (`f15615c`): Purely administrative sessions (no Write/Edit calls) now correctly bypass enforcement via the trivial mechanism fixed by BUG-01.
- **BUG-06** (`0ca5f99`): `modularity/SKILL.md` Rationalization Prevention table extended with 3 planning-intent excuse rows and an Adversarial mode rule — "tracked in backlog / milestone plan / next phase" are no longer accepted as deferrals during review.

### Consistency & Quality (QA)

- **QA-05** (`dfe856d`): `dev-cycle-check.sh` tamper-detection now skips `git`/`gh` commands entirely and checks only the first command line — prevents false-positive blocks when commit messages or `gh --body` arguments mention the state file path. Two new tests (17e, 17f) cover the fix.
- **QA-06** (`dfe856d`): Doc-scheme compliance gate (conditional pre-ship step) ported to `silver-bugfix` (Step 7c), `silver-devops` (Step 10b), and both forge variants.

### Feature (FEAT)

- **FEAT-01** (`dfe856d`): `/silver:init` now prompts for project management system (GitHub Issues or GSD) in new Step 2.8. Answer written as `issue_tracker` field in `.silver-bullet.json` (default: `"gsd"`). `silver-feature` backlog-capture steps now route to `gh issue create` or `gsd-add-backlog` based on the configured value.

### Skills — doc-scheme gates (#37, #38)

- **DOC-SCH-03**: Added doc-scheme compliance gate to both `silver-ui` variants (PR #38).
- **DOC-SCH-04**: Forward-ported doc-scheme compliance gate to `forge/skills/silver-feature` and `forge/skills/silver-ui` (PR #37).

## [0.23.10] — 2026-04-24

**Forge-SB port + ci-status-check deadlock fix (Bug 2).** Ships Silver Bullet for Forge (34 Forge-native skills), fixes the remaining CI-gate deadlock (#32 — PostToolUse commit was hard-blocked; now warns only), and closes three open issues (#30, #33, installer curl|bash). Pre-release quality gate: 4-stage automated review (code review, consistency audit, public content refresh, security), all four stages clean.

### Forge-SB port (PR #35)

- **FORGE-01**: Added `forge/skills/` directory with 34 Forge-native SKILL.md files mirroring the Silver Bullet CC skill set — GSD workflows (12), quality dimensions (9 + master), Superpowers dependencies (7), silver orchestrators (6), plus AGENTS.md global and project templates.
- **FORGE-02**: Added `forge/scripts/install.sh` and `forge/AGENTS.md` — entry point for Forge-based projects. Forge uses `id:` frontmatter and `AGENTS.md` files; CC uses `name:` and `/plugin install`.
- **FORGE-03**: Added `forge/skills/tests/smoke_test.sh` — 33-assertion smoke test (all skills present + installer exists). All green before merge.
- **FORGE-04**: Restored `forge/skills/` after post-merge cleanup accidentally deleted it (d804e76).
- **FORGE-05**: Added missing `name:` frontmatter to forge-sb ported CC wrapper skills that were missing it.

### Hooks — ci-status-check.sh (#32)

- **BUG2-01**: PostToolUse/`git commit` now emits a **warning** instead of `decision:block` — the commit has already happened; blocking PostToolUse confused the model about whether the commit succeeded and created a deadlock when trying to commit a CI fix. Push, PR, and release operations remain hard-blocked.
- **BUG2-02**: Corrected the `ci-red-override` escape instruction in the CI failure message from "If you need to commit a CI fix" → "If you need to **push** a CI fix" — `git commit` is never blocked by the CI gate, so the instruction now accurately describes the only operation that needs the override.
- **BUG2-03**: Added Group 6 regression test (PreToolUse commit not blocked when CI red) and Group 7 regression tests (PostToolUse commit is warn-not-block, with a compound `git commit && git push` guard ensuring the push component routes to `emit_block`). Test suite: 14 tests, 14/0. Full suite: 1300/0, 4/4 green.
- **DOC-01**: README Layer 5 description updated to reflect the warn/block split for commit vs. push/PR/release.
- **DOC-02**: README manual escape hatch section rewritten — removed stale "CI fix commit" scenario; added dedicated ci-red-override guidance with correct "push" framing.
- **DOC-03**: `site/index.html` version badge updated `v0.23.8` → `v0.23.10`.

### Skills — doc-scheme compliance gate (#33)

- **DOC-SCH-01**: Added Step 13b to `silver-feature/SKILL.md` — before raising a PR, check whether `docs/doc-scheme.md` exists; if it does, gate on 4 doc updates (CHANGELOG entry, ARCHITECTURE current state, `knowledge/`, `learnings/`) before proceeding to Step 14 (finishing branch). Missing entries are treated as pre-ship defects.
- **DOC-SCH-02**: Added a `## Documentation` section to the `writing-plans` PLAN.md template so the doc-scheme obligation is visible at plan-writing time, not just at ship time.

### Skills — enforcement cleanup (#30)

- **RULES-01**: Removed misleading `review-loop-pass` bash snippet from `core-rules.md §3a` — the snippet showed `echo "review-loop-pass" >> state`, which tamper-detection blocks and which was removed from `required_deploy` in v0.23.6. The doc was describing a mechanism that no longer works.

### silver-init

- **INIT-01**: `silver-init/SKILL.md` — purge stale hook entries on update. When re-running `/silver:init` on an existing project, obsolete hook registrations from prior versions are removed before adding current ones.

### Installer

- **INST-01**: `scripts/install.sh` — support `curl | bash` remote install pattern. The installer now detects when it is running from a pipe (no TTY) and skips interactive prompts, enabling `curl -fsSL https://… | bash` one-liner installs.

### Cleanup

- **CLN-01**: Removed orphan `skills/ai-llm-safety/ai-llm-safety/SKILL.md` double-nested directory created by a path-join bug. The canonical file at `skills/ai-llm-safety/SKILL.md` is unaffected.
- **CLN-02**: Stripped `FLOW N` serial numbers from execution headings and templates — numbers were redundant with section titles and made reordering flows expensive.
- **CLN-03**: Updated composition proposal box style — full border, clean flow names.
- **CLN-04**: `site/index.html` copy improvements — capitalize "Composable" in compare card; use "orchestrates" language in Ecosystem and Compare sections.

## [0.23.9] — 2026-04-20

**Hotfix — ci-status-check deadlock (Bug 1) + dev-cycle false positive.** Two hook bugs introduced in v0.23.8 and surfaced in production. Both have TDD regression tests; suite at 1152/0, 4/4 green before tagging.

### Hooks — ci-status-check.sh (Bug 1)

- **BUG1-01**: `ci-status-check.sh` was blocking `git commit` at **PreToolUse** when CI was red, creating an unrecoverable deadlock — Claude could not commit the fix needed to make CI green. Fixed by splitting the trigger scope by hook event: PreToolUse blocks only `git push` and deploy operations (never `git commit`); PostToolUse warns after commit so Claude knows CI is red before pushing.

### Hooks — dev-cycle-check.sh

- **DC-01**: The fallback self-protection pattern `/silver-bullet[^/]*/hooks/` (used when `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is unset) also matched the silver-bullet source repo's own `hooks/` directory, blocking legitimate hook edits during development. Restricted the fallback to paths provably inside `$HOME/.codex/` (the installed plugin location only).

## [0.23.8] — 2026-04-20

**Pre-release quality gate patch.** Ten-round automated code-review sweep (Layers A/B/C × multiple passes) found and fixed shell-script safety regressions, incorrect hook output formats, and documentation drift. Rounds 9 and 10 both returned zero findings.

### Shell script hardening
- **RM-01**: All `rm -f` calls in `scripts/` hardened with `--` separator (`semantic-compress.sh`, `deploy-gate-snippet.sh`, `sync-marketplace-version.sh`, `tfidf-rank.sh`) — project invariant now covers both `hooks/` and `scripts/`.
- **TRAP-01**: `phase-archive.sh` ERR trap output corrected from PostToolUse block format to PreToolUse `permissionDecision:deny` format — hook was emitting invalid JSON on archive failures.
- **TRAP-02**: `pr-traceability.sh` trap disarm extended to include `INT TERM` (`trap - EXIT INT TERM`) — prior form left handlers live across `wait` calls.
- **SC2015-01**: `session-log-init.sh` two `A&&B||C` awk pipelines rewritten as `if/then/else` — eliminates SC2015 false-success risk on `awk` exit.
- **TRAIL-01**: `roadmap-freshness.sh` final code path now exits 0 explicitly after its informational `printf` — missing `exit 0` could propagate unexpected exit codes.

### Test fixes
- **TEST-01**: `test-session-log-init.sh` sentinel kill calls fixed to extract bare PID from `pid:lstart` format before `kill` — was passing the full `pid:lstart` string, causing `kill` to error silently.

### Documentation & consistency
- **DOC-01**: `site/index.html` version badge updated `v0.22.0` → `v0.23.8`.
- **DOC-02**: `docs/internal/CICD.md` shellcheck command updated to match CI (`--exclude=SC2317,SC1091,SC2329 hooks/*.sh hooks/lib/*.sh scripts/*.sh`); CI step table brought current with all pipeline steps added since v0.22.

## [0.23.7] — 2026-04-20

**Hotfix.** SC2015 rewrite of `compliance-status.sh` in v0.23.6 lost the executable bit on the file, causing the hook to fail silently.

### Fixes
- **HOT-01**: Restored `+x` permission on `compliance-status.sh` (lost during SC2015 rewrite).
- **HOT-02**: Rewrote remaining `A&&B||C` patterns in `compliance-status.sh` as `if/then/else` to satisfy shellcheck SC2015 without the permission regression.
- Additional code review pass (2 rounds, both clean before release).

## [0.23.6] — 2026-04-20

**Issue-cleanup patch.** Resolved 5 open GitHub issues: CI Node deprecation, semver validation in `silver-update`, review-loop-pass marker conflict, trivial-file name confusion, and cryptographic tag signing.

### CI
- **CI-01**: All GitHub Actions workflows opt into Node.js 24 via `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24: true` — eliminates Node 20 deprecation warnings ahead of June 2026 deadline.

### silver-update (#29)
- **UPD-SEC-01**: `$LATEST` is validated as a semver string (`X.Y.Z`) before use in any file path or `git ref` — prevents path-traversal or ref injection from a crafted GitHub API response.

### Enforcement — review-loop-pass (#30)
- **ENF-01**: `review-loop-pass` marker removed from `required_deploy` list — the marker is written by `record-skill.sh` only after a manual Skill invocation, but the review-loop mechanism writes it via a direct state-file append, which `completion-audit.sh`'s tamper-detection hook blocked. Unblocking deploys that used the loop correctly.

### Trivial bypass naming (#31)
- **TRV-01**: Separated the two semantics that lived in a single touch-file (`trivial`): `trivial` now means "session has not modified any files" (bypass all enforcement); a new `ci-red-override` file is created when the user explicitly overrides a red CI gate. The two are no longer conflated.

### Cryptographic tag signing (#28)
- **SEC-01**: `silver-create-release` SKILL.md updated to sign Git tags with GPG when `git config user.signingkey` is set (`git tag -s`). Release process now optionally produces signed tags verifiable with `git tag -v`.

## [0.23.5] — 2026-04-19

**Skill hardening patch.** Iterative audit of `silver-update` and `silver-migrate` SKILL.md files closed terminology drift, missing template sections, and unresolved bash placeholders. Source verified across 4 independent agent audits (last 2 passes clean).

### silver-update
- **UPD-01**: Added explicit trigger phrase to description (`when the user runs /silver:update`) for skill-development compliance.
- **UPD-02**: Replaced fragile `curl | grep | sed` tag parse with `jq -r '.tag_name' | sed 's/^v//'` (jq is already a project prerequisite).
- **UPD-03**: Bound `$LATEST`, `$NEW_CACHE`, `$COMMIT_SHA`, `$NOW` as real shell variables. Removed unquoted/unresolved `<latest-version>` placeholders from executable commands.
- **UPD-04**: Atomic registry write — `mktemp` + `mv` with a concrete `jq --arg` expression that updates `version`, `installPath`, `lastUpdated`, `gitCommitSha`. Prevents mid-write corruption.
- **UPD-05**: Cancel-path `rm -rf` guarded by `$HOME/.codex/plugins/cache/` prefix match.

### silver-migrate
- **MIG-01**: Description updated with explicit `/silver:migrate` trigger + pre-v0.20.0 context.
- **MIG-02**: Fixed terminology drift — prose now consistently uses "flow/Flows" to match `templates/workflow.md.base` (`Flow Log`, `Next Flow`). Eliminates mismatched section headings in generated `.planning/WORKFLOW.md`.
- **MIG-03**: Renamed "Next Path section" → "Next Flow section" so emitted heading matches the template.
- **MIG-04**: Added instructions to emit `## Dynamic Insertions`, `## Autonomous Decisions`, and `## Deferred Improvements` empty-header tables (previously omitted — generated WORKFLOW.md was missing 3 template sections).
- **MIG-05**: Template read path now uses `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/workflow.md.base` so it no longer depends on the downstream project's CWD.
- **MIG-06**: Disambiguated FLOW 13 (SHIP — `gsd-ship` / `deploy-checklist`) from FLOW 17 (RELEASE — `silver-create-release`). Previously both claimed `silver-create-release`.

## [0.23.4] — 2026-04-19

**Marketplace hardening.** Fixes version drift, modernizes the marketplace `source` schema, and introduces a dedicated marketplace repo so future Ālo Labs plugins can be cataloged together.

### Marketplace
- **MKTP-01**: Fixed stale version in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (`0.13.1` → `0.23.4`). Was 10 releases out of date.
- **MKTP-02**: Modernized `source` schema from the older nested `{"source":"url","url":"..."}` form to the current `"source": "github:alo-exp/silver-bullet"` shorthand.
- **MKTP-03**: Created dedicated marketplace repo [alo-labs/claude-plugins](https://github.com/alo-labs/claude-plugins). End-users can now install via:
  ```
  /plugin marketplace add alo-labs/claude-plugins
  /plugin install silver-bullet@alo-labs
  ```
  (The self-listed `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` in this repo remains for direct-repo installs: `/plugin marketplace add alo-exp/silver-bullet`.)
- **MKTP-04**: Added `scripts/sync-marketplace-version.sh` — bumps the in-repo marketplace.json to match plugin.json and prints the remote-sync command for the alo-labs/claude-plugins repo.
- **MKTP-05**: Added CI guard in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that fails the build if `plugin.json.version ≠ marketplace.json.plugins[silver-bullet].version`. Prevents future drift.

## [0.23.3] — 2026-04-19

**Full 100%-vs-100% plugin-dev compliance audit.** Extracted 66 requirements across all 7 plugin-dev skills + 2 validator agents, verified SB against each, fixed all FAIL + material WARN findings, and gated release on two consecutive independent clean audits. Full audit trail in `.planning/PLUGIN-DEV-COMPLIANCE.md`.

### Resolved FAIL
- **FAIL-01**: `silver-init/SKILL.md` reduced from 5,454 → 3,459 words (under skill-development's 5,000 hard max). Phase 3 scaffold detail extracted to `skills/silver-init/references/scaffold-steps.md`.

### Resolved WARN
- **WARN-01**: Added `trap 'exit 0' ERR` to the 4 hooks that lacked it (`completion-audit.sh`, `forbidden-skill-check.sh`, `roadmap-freshness.sh`, `stop-check.sh`). Now universal across all 17 registered hooks, matching the project's stated invariant.
- **WARN-02**: Added concrete user-phrase triggers to all 9 quality-dimension skill descriptions (`security`, `reliability`, `modularity`, `scalability`, `testability`, `extensibility`, `reusability`, `usability`, `ai-llm-safety`). Triggers now phrase-based ("when the user asks to 'harden X'", "'add retries'", etc.) per skill-development §Description Quality.
- **WARN-08**: Deleted dead hook script `hooks/ensure-model-routing.sh` (was executable but unregistered in `hooks.json`).
- **WARN-09**: Added `"matcher": "startup|clear|compact"` to first SessionStart block in `hooks/hooks.json` for consistency.

### Audit methodology
Full systematic audit delegated to independent agents:
1. Extract every MUST/SHOULD/anti-pattern from plugin-dev authority docs
2. Verify 100% of SB (41 skills, 17 hooks, manifest, lib) against each requirement
3. Write findings to `.planning/PLUGIN-DEV-COMPLIANCE.md` with file-level evidence
4. Fix all FAIL + material WARN
5. Re-audit independently until 2 consecutive clean passes
6. Gate release on clean-pass verdict

Final audit: **66 requirements checked, 59 PASS, 0 FAIL, 3 accepted WARN (deliberate design choices), 4 N/A.**

## [0.23.2] — 2026-04-19

**plugin-dev compliance — broader-scope audit.** Re-ran the audit iteratively against a wider checklist (shellcheck, executability, schema, semver, name/dir parity, description length bounds) until two consecutive passes reported zero findings.

### Hook lib cleanliness
- **SHELL-01**: Added `# shellcheck shell=bash` directive to `hooks/lib/required-skills.sh` so shellcheck recognizes the shell for sourced-only files (SC2148).
- **SHELL-02**: Added `# shellcheck disable=SC2034` to `DEFAULT_REQUIRED` and `DEVOPS_DEFAULT_REQUIRED` since they are consumed via `source`, not in-file.

### Audit coverage (all passing)
- All 41 skills: plugin-dev description opener, version field, no grammar mismatches
- All 24 hook entries: `type` + `timeout` present
- Shellcheck: zero warnings + zero errors across `hooks/*.sh` and `hooks/lib/*.sh`
- plugin.json: all required fields (name, version, description, hooks, author, license)
- All three JSON files valid
- No 2nd-person imperative prose in skill bodies
- All hook scripts executable
- Semver compliant

## [0.23.1] — 2026-04-19

**plugin-dev compliance patch.** Second-pass audit surfaced residual gaps from v0.23.0 that passed the first-pass checks but failed a stricter re-scan. Two consecutive clean audit passes achieved before release.

### Skill descriptions
- **DESC-NORM**: Normalized 32 remaining skill descriptions to the plugin-dev standard `"This skill should be used when/for/to ..."` opener. Prior release fixed 9; this release fixes the rest. All 41 skills now conform.
- **DESC-GRAMMAR**: Fixed 6 imperative-verb grammar mismatches (`"used for apply"` → `"used to apply"`, etc.) across `artifact-review-assessor`, `devops-quality-gates`, `silver-blast-radius`, `silver-create-release`, `silver-migrate`, `silver-review-stats`, `silver-init`, `silver-update`, `silver`.

### Writing style
- **STYLE-02**: Fixed 3 residual second-person aphorisms in `security/SKILL.md` (`"your denylist"`, `"roll your own crypto"`, `"Rolling your own crypto"`). Dialog/error-message examples with 2nd-person left intact as legitimate example content.
- **STYLE-03**: Fixed 2 additional 2nd-person violations in `silver-init` (`"You can safely delete..."`) and `silver-spec` (`"include in your phrasing"`).

### Audit methodology
Cleanroom multi-pass audit introduced: scan → fix → re-scan until two consecutive passes report zero findings across manifest fields, hook timeouts, skill frontmatter, description grammar, prose style, and JSON validity.

## [0.23.0] — 2026-04-19

**plugin-dev compliance milestone.** Retroactively aligns 100% of Silver Bullet against the official Anthropic `plugin-dev` plugin standards — manifest, hooks, skills, and writing style.

### Plugin-dev Compliance (Phase 1 — Manifest & Hooks)
- **PLUGIN-01**: Added `"hooks": "./hooks/hooks.json"` field to `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` per plugin-dev `plugin-structure` standard.
- **PLUGIN-02**: Added explicit `timeout` fields to all 24 hook entries in `hooks/hooks.json` (values: 5–30s per hook criticality).
- **PLUGIN-03**: Bumped `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` version to `0.23.0`.

### plugin-dev Compliance (Phase 2 — Skill Descriptions & Versions)
- **SKILL-DESC**: Fixed 9 skill descriptions from bare "Use when..." to plugin-dev standard "This skill should be used when..." format: `ai-llm-safety`, `extensibility`, `modularity`, `reliability`, `reusability`, `scalability`, `security`, `testability`, `usability`.
- **SKILL-VER**: Added `version: 0.1.0` to YAML frontmatter of all 41 skills.

### plugin-dev Compliance (Phase 3 — Progressive Disclosure)
- **SILVER-FEATURE**: Extracted Supervision Loop detail (SL-1 → SL-6, ~400 words) to `skills/silver-feature/references/supervision-loop.md`; replaced with lean pointer. Word count: 3,049 → 2,704.
- **SILVER-INIT**: Extracted 4 heavy sections to references/scripts:
  - CI workflow YAML templates → `skills/silver-init/references/ci-templates.md` (13 stacks)
  - Doc migration procedure → `skills/silver-init/references/doc-migration.md`
  - Tech stack detection table → `skills/silver-init/references/stack-detection.md`
  - Hooks-merge Python script → `skills/silver-init/scripts/merge-hooks.py` (executable, chmod 755)
  - Word count: 6,446 → 5,419.

### plugin-dev Compliance (Phase 4 — Writing Style)
- **STYLE**: Fixed 23 second-person writing violations across 9 skills (imperative verb-first style):
  - All 7 ilities skills: `"You are NOT required to X"` → `"Not required to X"`, `"You ARE required to not make X worse"` → `"Required: do not make X worse"`, and related pronoun drops.
  - `silver-spec`: `"You MUST NOT proceed"` → `"Do NOT proceed"`.
  - `devops-skill-router`: `"You can also invoke"` → `"Also invocable"`.

### Documentation
- **CLAUDE.md**: Complete rewrite — added commands (test suite, linting, validation), full architecture reference (hook event map, two-tier enforcement, state machine, shared libraries), key invariants.

## [0.22.0] — 2026-04-18

**Backlog-resolution milestone.** Consolidates phases 34–38: security hardening,
hook-correctness fixes, consistency repairs, gitignore narrowing, and a full
public-surface refresh. Subsumes the undocumented 0.20.9 → 0.21.3 release window
into a single coherent entry. Closes issues [#14](https://github.com/alo-exp/silver-bullet/issues/14),
[#16](https://github.com/alo-exp/silver-bullet/issues/16),
[#20](https://github.com/alo-exp/silver-bullet/issues/20),
[#23](https://github.com/alo-exp/silver-bullet/issues/23).

### Security
- **SEC-01** (P34, `6cb66c5`): moved the Google Chat release-notification webhook out of `skills/silver-create-release/SKILL.md` into the `GCHAT_RELEASE_WEBHOOK` env var; added a `secret-scan` CI job that fails the build on hard-coded webhook URLs.
- **SEC-02** (P35, `e247ff3`): added `! -L` symlink guards to every hook that reads/writes state files (`stop-check.sh`, `session-start`, `completion-audit.sh`, trivial-flag touch/rm) — closes a symlink-replacement bypass on multi-user machines.
- **SEC-03** (P35, `e247ff3`): replaced hand-rolled JSON string concatenation in hook stdout with `jq -n` payloads across every hook that emits `PreToolUse`/`Stop` structured output — eliminates injection via filenames or branch names containing quotes.
- **SEC-04** (P35, `e247ff3`): batch security fixes across remaining hooks (safe `rm` patterns, `mktemp` for temp files, `set -euo pipefail` where missing).

### Fixes
- **HOOK-06** (P36, `4339060`): `stop-check.sh` no longer fails open when `.silver-bullet.json` is missing or unreadable — absent config now HARD-STOPs with a config-error message instead of silently allowing session end.
- **HOOK-07** (P36, `4339060`): closed a race in `stop-check.sh` where a concurrent `record-skill.sh` write could cause the required-skills diff to observe a stale state file; added flock around state reads on Stop.
- **HOOK-08** (P36, `4339060`): filled test coverage for the HOOK-14 trivial-session / clean-tree short-circuit paths in `stop-check.sh` (clean tree, dirty tree, trivial flag, read-only session matrix).
- **HOOK-14** carryover: `stop-check` skips enforcement for read-only sessions ([#14](https://github.com/alo-exp/silver-bullet/issues/14) via `58d98fb` / `efdaab5`).

### Consistency
- **CONS-01** (P37, `0b86dc6`): repaired broken skill references — `/gsd:silver-forensics` → `/gsd-forensics`, legacy `/silver:*` colon-form refs in SKILL.md files updated to current `/silver-*` names.
- **CONS-02** (P37, `0b86dc6`): reconciled `hooks.json` / `settings.json` schema drift; every hook entry now matches the Claude Code manifest schema and the registered hook script actually exists on disk.

### Ignore
- **IGNORE-01** (P38, this release, closes [#20](https://github.com/alo-exp/silver-bullet/issues/20)): narrowed the project `.gitignore` blanket `.codex/` rule to runtime-only subpaths (`projects/`, `local/`, `.silver-bullet/`, `settings.local.json`, `worktrees/`). Committed plugin config (`.codex/settings.json`, `.codex/commands/`) now tracked. Supersedes the interim fix in `c8b161a`.

### Docs
- **DOC-02** (P38, this release, closes [#23](https://github.com/alo-exp/silver-bullet/issues/23)): public-surface refresh across every user-visible file.
  - `README.md`: `Current version` bumped from v0.21.3 → v0.22.0 with milestone summary.
  - `site/index.html`: hero version badge v0.19.1 → v0.22.0; meta description / Twitter card skill count 39 → 41, added "18 hooks".
  - `site/help/getting-started/index.html`, `site/help/concepts/index.html`: skill count 39 → 41; version range extended to v0.22.0; added composable-flows line.
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: design principle 2 corrected from "7 layers" → "10 layers" to match enforcement-layer count everywhere else.
  - `CHANGELOG.md`: this entry, consolidating 0.20.9–0.21.3 gap into the 0.22.0 release note.

### Tests
- Total: 1112 passed, 13 failed (2/3 suites green) — unchanged from v0.21.3 baseline. Hook coverage: 18/18.

## [0.20.8] — 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- `skills/silver-forensics/SKILL.md`: replaced 4 occurrences of non-existent `/gsd:silver-forensics` routing with correct `/gsd-forensics`. The bug caused silent agent failure when Silver Bullet tried to delegate GSD workflow issues to a command that never existed.

### Tests
- `tests/integration/test-skill-integrity.sh`: added Check 8 — regression test asserting `silver-forensics/SKILL.md` does not reference `/gsd:silver-forensics`. RED-GREEN verified.
- Total: 288 tests, 3/3 suites green.

### Docs / Planning
- Autonomous mode preference recorded in `silver-bullet.md §10e` and base template.
- `ROADMAP.md ## Backlog`: 17 deferred items (999.1–999.17) captured from forensics sweep and added for future work.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: corrected stale "972 tests" count in v0.20.6 entry to correct value (288).

## [0.20.7] — 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- `hooks/session-start`: now honours `SILVER_BULLET_STATE_FILE` env var (same pattern as `completion-audit.sh` and `stop-check.sh`), allowing tests to redirect state writes to a temp path.
- `tests/hooks/test-session-start.sh`: replaced fragile backup/restore machinery with `TMPSTATE` isolation via `SILVER_BULLET_STATE_FILE`. Running the full test suite no longer wipes the live session state file, ending the skill re-recording loop that blocked session completion after every test run.

### Tests
- Total: 288 tests, 3/3 suites green (no new tests — existing 12 session-start tests now run in full isolation)

## [0.20.6] — 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- `hooks/roadmap-freshness.sh`: new PreToolUse/Bash hook that blocks `git commit` when a phase `*-SUMMARY.md` is staged but the corresponding ROADMAP.md checkbox is not ticked (`[ ]`). Prevents autonomous execution from silently skipping the ROADMAP bookkeeping step.
- `skills/silver-feature/SKILL.md`: added explicit "TICK ROADMAP.md" step to the Per-Phase Loop so autonomous runs update the checkbox before the phase-completion commit.
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md`: ticked checkboxes for phases 23, 24, 27, 28 which were completed in the prior milestone but not updated due to the missing enforcement.

### Tests
- Total: 972 tests, 3/3 suites green (8 new tests for roadmap-freshness hook)

## [0.20.5] — 2026-04-16

### Changed
- `/silver` skill: renamed from "Smart Skill Router" to "Smart Skill Orchestrator" — better reflects its role composing and sequencing workflows rather than just dispatching
- Composable workflow building blocks renamed from "paths" to "flows" throughout: `silver-feature/SKILL.md` (20 occurrences in Composition Proposal and Supervision Loop), `silver/SKILL.md` (Composer note), `silver-bullet.md.base` §2h ("Composable Flows Catalog"), `ENFORCEMENT.md` ("composable flows mode"), `full-dev-cycle.md` both templates and docs copies

### Tests
- Total: 962 tests, 3/3 suites green

## [0.20.4] — 2026-04-16

### Changed
- All user-facing Silver Bullet skills now use the `/silver-*` naming convention: `blast-radius` → `silver-blast-radius`, `create-release` → `silver-create-release`, `forensics` → `silver-forensics`, `quality-gates` → `silver-quality-gates`. End users now see a clean `/silver-*` namespace in the Claude Code slash command menu.
- `hooks/lib/required-skills.sh`, `hooks/record-skill.sh`, `hooks/completion-audit.sh`, `hooks/stop-check.sh`, `hooks/dev-cycle-check.sh`: updated all references to use new skill names
- `.silver-bullet.json`, `templates/silver-bullet.config.json.default`: `required_planning`, `required_deploy`, and `all_tracked` arrays updated to new names
- 22 internal skills (dimension checkers, artifact reviewers, internal routing skills) marked `user-invocable: false` in SKILL.md frontmatter — hidden from Claude Code slash command menu to reduce context token overhead for end users
- README.md: all skill name references updated to new `silver-*` convention

### Tests
- Total: 962 tests, 3/3 suites green

## [0.20.3] — 2026-04-15

### Added
- `create-release` skill: Step 5 posts a Google Chat notification after publishing a release. Reads `notifications.google_chat_webhook` from `.silver-bullet.json`; silent skip if absent; warns but does not fail if `curl` errors.
- `.silver-bullet.json`: `notifications.google_chat_webhook` config key for project-local webhook URL storage.

## [0.20.2] — 2026-04-15

### Refactored
- `hooks/lib/workflow-utils.sh` (new): shared utility library — single source of truth for Flow Log row-counting regex, extracted from three hooks (TD-1)
- `completion-audit.sh`, `dev-cycle-check.sh`, `compliance-status.sh`: source shared lib with inline fallback definitions for resilience in test environments
- Fixed stale "workflow paths" terminology in `completion-audit.sh` output messages → "flows" (TD-2)

### Added
- Comprehensive skill execution path test suite: 169 tests covering sub-skill reference integrity, non-skippable gate presence, step ordering constraints, quality-gates 9-dimension completeness, and skill name consistency across all 41 orchestration skills (TD-3)

### Tests
- Total: 962 tests, 3/3 suites green (up from 793 in v0.20.0)

## [0.20.1] — 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- `compliance-status.sh` Bug-1: WORKFLOW.md flow progress (`FLOW N/M`) now shown in early-exit path (no state file) — was omitted before this fix
- `compliance-status.sh` Bug-2: Row-count regex tightened from `^\| [0-9]` to `^\| [0-9]+ \|` — Phase Iterations and Autonomous Decisions rows no longer inflate the total flow count
- Same Bug-2 regex fix applied to `completion-audit.sh` and `dev-cycle-check.sh` (same pattern, same exposure)

### Changed
- Terminology rename: "paths" → "flows" and "Composable Path Architecture" → "Composable Workflow Orchestration" project-wide (42 files)
- WORKFLOW.md sections renamed: `Path Log` → `Flow Log`, `Next Path` → `Next Flow`, `Last-path:` → `Last-flow:`
- Status output updated: `PATH N/M` → `FLOW N/M`, `PATH: N/A (legacy mode)` → `FLOW: N/A (legacy mode)`
- `dev-cycle-check.sh` stale messages updated: "All workflow paths complete" → "All flows complete", partial-progress "PATH %s/%s" → "FLOW %s/%s"

### Added
- 7-scenario integration test suite for `compliance-status.sh` WORKFLOW.md flow-progress display (S1–S7 covering early-exit, symlink, malformed, digit-row false positives, mixed counts)
- Bug-2 inflation regression tests for `completion-audit.sh` (WF3) and `dev-cycle-check.sh` (WF5)

## [0.15.3] — 2026-04-10

### Fixed — SENTINEL v2.3 Security Audit Findings
- SENTINEL-9.1: Sanitize VALIDATION.md warn_items in pr-traceability.sh — strip markdown link syntax and wrap in code fence to prevent injection into PR descriptions
- SENTINEL-3.1: Reject overly permissive src_pattern values (e.g., `.*`, `.+`, `/`) in dev-cycle-check.sh — fall back to `/src/` default
- Full SENTINEL v2.3 8-step adversarial security audit report: `SENTINEL-audit-silver-bullet-v0.15.1.md`

## [0.15.1] — 2026-04-09

### Fixed — Pre-Release QA Gate Findings
- CR-01: Resolve gh CLI at runtime in pr-traceability.sh (cross-platform, was hardcoded /opt/homebrew/bin/gh)
- CR-02: Remove --no-verify from auto-commit in pr-traceability.sh (was bypassing hook chain)
- CR-03: Validate spec_version (dotted semver) and jira_id (uppercase project key) before shell use
- WR-03: Add quote-stripping to uat-gate.sh spec-version comparison (prevents false mismatch on quoted YAML)
- WR-06: Add 'Accepted' to valid assumption status in review-spec QC-5
- WR-07: Align ingestion manifest status vocabulary (success/failed/skipped) across QC-1..5
- Idempotent awk insert in pr-traceability.sh SPEC.md Implementations (prevents duplicate entries)
- Diagnostic ERR traps in pr-traceability.sh and uat-gate.sh (was silent exit 0)
- package.json version updated to match release (was stale at 0.13.0)

## [0.15.0] — 2026-04-09

### Added — Granular Artifact Review Rounds (v0.15.0)
- Artifact reviewer framework: `skills/artifact-reviewer/SKILL.md` with
  interface contract (`reviewer-interface.md`), 2-consecutive-clean-pass
  loop (`review-loop.md`), per-artifact state tracking, and audit trail
- 8 new artifact reviewer skills: `review-spec`, `review-design`,
  `review-requirements`, `review-roadmap`, `review-context`,
  `review-research`, `review-ingestion-manifest`, `review-uat`
- Existing GSD reviewers (plan-checker, code-reviewer, verifier,
  security-auditor) formalized into the 2-pass framework via silver-bullet.md §3a
- Workflow wiring: silver-spec Steps 7a/8a/9a, silver-ingest Step 7a,
  silver-feature Step 17.0a — all NON-SKIPPABLE gates
- Post-command review gates in §3a-i for ROADMAP, REQUIREMENTS, CONTEXT, RESEARCH
- Complete artifact-reviewer mapping table in §3a (12 artifact types)

### Fixed — v0.14.0 Critical Bug Fixes
- BFIX-01: Shell injection via unvalidated owner/repo in `silver-ingest --source-url` — allowlist regex validation added
- BFIX-02: Command injection via unescaped WARN findings in `pr-traceability.sh` heredoc — replaced with `printf '%s'`
- BFIX-03: Confluence failure path now produces `[ARTIFACT MISSING: reason]` block (was buried in Assumptions)
- BFIX-04: Version mismatch block in §0/5.5 now shows content diff (was version numbers only)

## [0.14.0] — 2026-04-09

### Added — AI-Driven Spec & Multi-Repo Orchestration
- `skills/silver-spec/SKILL.md` — AI-driven Socratic elicitation skill (238 lines)
  guiding PM/BA through 9-domain requirements creation, producing SPEC.md + REQUIREMENTS.md
- `skills/silver-ingest/SKILL.md` — External artifact ingestion (428 lines) via
  JIRA (Atlassian MCP), Figma (Figma MCP), Google Docs (Workspace CLI with vision).
  Cross-repo spec fetch with version pinning. Resumable via INGESTION_MANIFEST.md
- `skills/silver-validate/SKILL.md` — Pre-build gap analysis (360 lines) with
  BLOCK/WARN/INFO findings. Hard-blocks gsd-plan-phase on BLOCK findings
- `hooks/spec-floor-check.sh` — PreToolUse hook that hard-blocks gsd-plan-phase
  without valid SPEC.md; advisory-only for gsd-fast/gsd-quick
- `hooks/spec-session-record.sh` — SessionStart hook capturing spec-id/version/JIRA ref
- `hooks/pr-traceability.sh` — PostToolUse hook auto-populating PR description with
  spec reference and updating SPEC.md Implementations section post-merge
- `hooks/uat-gate.sh` — PreToolUse hook blocking gsd-complete-milestone without UAT pass
- Canonical spec templates: `templates/specs/SPEC.md.template`, `DESIGN.md.template`,
  `REQUIREMENTS.md.template` with YAML frontmatter and standardized sections
- Multi-repo spec referencing: `silver-ingest --source-url` fetches + caches main repo
  SPEC.md with version pinning; session-start validation blocks on mismatch
- §3/§3a/§3d step non-skip enforcement: workflow steps cannot be bypassed, artifact
  existence required before phase advancement
- Spec Lifecycle section in silver-bullet.md.base
- MCP Connector Prerequisites (§2j) and Cross-Repo Conventions (§2k)

## [0.13.2] — 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- All hooks that used `set -euo pipefail` without an ERR trap now have
  `trap 'exit 0' ERR` added. Affected files: `hooks/session-start`,
  `hooks/compliance-status.sh`, `hooks/session-log-init.sh`,
  `hooks/ensure-model-routing.sh`, `hooks/semantic-compress.sh`,
  `hooks/record-skill.sh`, `hooks/ci-status-check.sh`,
  `hooks/dev-cycle-check.sh`. Prevents first-install failures from
  surfacing nonzero hook exits that cause Claude to reject the plugin.
- Restored `"hooks": "./hooks/hooks.json"` to `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
  so the marketplace registers hooks automatically on install.

### Added
- `silver:init` Phase 3 step 3.7.5: after project scaffolding, merges SB
  hook entries from `hooks/hooks.json` into `$HOME/.codex/settings.json` using
  `python3`. Hook commands are registered with the actual install path
  substituted for `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`. Idempotent — re-running init
  does not add duplicate entries. Also runs during update mode (step 5a).

## [0.13.1] — 2026-04-09

### Changed
- Model routing overhauled: Sonnet (LOW thinking effort) is now the default for all 24 GSD agents. Opus reserved exclusively for `gsd-planner` and `gsd-security-auditor` — the only two agents where reasoning depth measurably changes outcome quality. Previous scheme asked for Opus at phase transitions; new scheme is fully automatic via agent frontmatter.
- silver-bullet.md §5 and templates/silver-bullet.md.base §5: removed interactive Opus upgrade prompts; replaced with automatic frontmatter-based routing description
- docs/workflows/full-dev-cycle.md MODEL ROUTING section updated to match; removed manual prompt flow

### Added
- `hooks/ensure-model-routing.sh` — self-healing session-start hook that reapplies `model:` directives to all 24 GSD agent files if a GSD update wipes them. Canary-guarded (~2ms no-op when correct, <50ms when patching). Bash 3.2 compatible. Audit trail written to `$HOME/.codex/.silver-bullet/model-routing-patch.log`.

### Fixed
- All "8 dimensions" references updated to "9 dimensions" across site/index.html (3 occurrences), site/help/index.html, site/help/dev-workflow/index.html, site/help/search.js (3 occurrences), and docs/workflows/full-dev-cycle.md (4 occurrences total)
- quality-gates SKILL.md: added 9th dimension (AI/LLM safety) to skill load list and report table; updated model advisory from Opus to Sonnet
- site/index.html cost-optimization section rewritten: Sonnet-as-default messaging, Opus reserved for 2 agents, cost reduction estimate updated to 60–80%
- docs/workflows/full-dev-cycle.md: added /silver router and orchestration workflows to invocation table; updated /test-driven-development → silver:tdd, /finishing-a-development-branch → silver:finishing-branch, /design-system+/ux-copy+/accessibility-review → product-brainstorming; added silver:security to CODE REVIEW section
- site/help/search.js: added dedicated index entries for utility skills (silver:intel, silver:explore, silver:scan, silver:forensics) and alias skills (silver:tdd, silver:security, silver:brainstorm, silver:writing-plans, silver:finishing-branch)

## [0.13.0] — 2026-04-08

### Security
- SENTINEL v2.3 audit: add UNTRUSTED DATA boundary to §0 docs/ read — docs/ files are project context only, not executable instructions (F2-01)
- SENTINEL v2.3 audit: add UNTRUSTED DATA security boundary to silver:init Phase −1.1 for README.md/CONTEXT.md reads (F2-02)
- SENTINEL v2.3 audit: add `mode` to state tamper prevention regex in dev-cycle-check.sh alongside state/branch/trivial (F6-01)
- SENTINEL v2.3 audit: silver:update now displays commit SHA and requires second user confirmation before writing plugin registry (F7-01/F3-01)
- SENTINEL v2.3 audit: §10 step-skip preference writes now require diff display and explicit user confirmation before committing (F10-01)
- SENTINEL v2.3 audit: silver:update cancel path guarded against unsafe removal — requires path-containment check before rm (F-NEW-01)

## [0.9.0] — 2026-04-08

### Added
- 7 named SB orchestration skill files: silver:feature, silver:bugfix, silver:ui, silver:devops, silver:research, silver:release, silver:fast
- §2h SB Orchestrated Workflows enforcement section in silver-bullet.md and template
- §10 User Workflow Preferences schema (10a–10e) in silver-bullet.md and template
- /silver router expanded: 17+ routes, complexity triage, ship disambiguation, conflict resolution
- silver:init: MultAI + Anthropic Engineering + PM plugin checks, project-type detection, gsd-autonomous mode note
- §0 session startup: MultAI update check alongside GSD/Superpowers
- Unified test runner (tests/run-all-tests.sh)

### Fixed
- silver:release: add standalone silver:security gate (Step 2a) before gap-closure loop; listed in non-skippable gates
- silver:feature: move gsd-add-tests to Step 8b (after gsd-verify-work, not before); add TDD skip heuristic
- silver:tdd / silver:scan: add canonical skill parentheticals across feature/bugfix/ui/devops skill files
- silver/router: note §10 preferences not applied when routing Trivial → silver:fast
- silver:init: document intentional MultAI hard-STOP vs Engineering/PM soft-warning asymmetry

### Infrastructure
- GSD state delegation: SB reads .planning/STATE.md instead of maintaining own state

## 0.12.1 (2026-04-07)

### Added
- `/silver:update` skill — one-command plugin updater: checks GitHub for latest release, shows changelog diff, confirms, clones new version into cache, and updates plugin registry

### Fixed
- `/silver` skill: removed unsupported `allowed-tools` frontmatter field that prevented the skill from loading in Claude Desktop
- Architecture section: 10th enforcement layer card now flows in 2-column grid (removed erroneous `grid-column:1/-1`)

## 0.12.0 (2026-04-07)

### Added
- `/silver` router skill — freeform dispatcher that routes natural language to the right Silver Bullet or GSD skill; delegates GSD intent to `/gsd:do` automatically
- Ten-layer enforcement model now fully documented in `silver-bullet.md` section 1 (Stop hook, UserPromptSubmit reminder, and Forbidden skill gate layers were previously undocumented)

### Changed
- Renamed `/using-silver-bullet` skill to `/silver:init` — shorter namespaced name consistent with the `/silver:*` namespace; project-wide update across all docs, site, help center, README, and hooks

### Fixed
- `record-skill.sh`: greedy namespace stripping loop (mirrors `forbidden-skill-check.sh`) — double-namespaced invocations (e.g., `outer:inner:quality-gates`) were silently untracked (SENTINEL S6-001)
- `silver-bullet.md` section 1: enforcement layer count corrected from 7 to 10; Stop hook, UserPromptSubmit reminder, and Forbidden skill gate now listed explicitly
- `site/index.html`: all enforcement layer count references corrected from 7 to 10; architecture section updated with three missing layer cards
- `site/compare/index.html`: enforcement layer count corrected from 7 to 10

### Tech Debt
- `hooks/lib/required-skills.sh`: extracted `DEFAULT_REQUIRED` as single source of truth; sourced by `stop-check.sh`, `completion-audit.sh`, `prompt-reminder.sh` with inline fallback (TD-01)
- `stop-check.sh`: extracted `check_quality_gate_stages()` as testable pure function (TD-04)
- `templates/silver-bullet.config.json.default`: added `config_version` field (TD-07)
- Added 4 new tests: double-namespace bypass (forbidden-skill), main-branch filter (prompt-reminder), path traversal defense (prompt-reminder), double-namespace record (record-skill)

## 0.11.0 (2026-04-06)

### Added
- Stop hook (`stop-check.sh`) — blocks Claude from declaring task complete when required skills are missing; fires on `Stop` and `SubagentStop` events, survives compaction
- UserPromptSubmit hook (`prompt-reminder.sh`) — re-injects missing-skill list and core enforcement rules before every user message
- Forbidden skill gate (`forbidden-skill-check.sh`) — PreToolUse hook blocks deprecated/forbidden skills before they execute; configurable via `skills.forbidden` in `.silver-bullet.json`
- Review-loop proxy enforcement — `review-loop-pass-1`/`review-loop-pass-2` markers tracked in stop-check and completion-audit as proxy for F-01 compliance
- Stage ordering validation — prevents falsifying stage sequence (e.g. recording stage-3 before stage-2)
- Automatic model switching — agent definitions route to optimal Claude model tier (Sonnet/Haiku/Opus) based on task type
- 183-test comprehensive E2E harness (`tests/run-all-tests.sh`) — 129 unit tests + 54 integration scenario tests with 100% hook coverage

### Fixed
- 16 enforcement gaps closed from post-v0.10.0 audit: branch mismatch warning, plugin cache write blocking, scripting language bypass prevention, generalized tamper regex, destructive command warning, `gh pr merge` delivery gate, completion-audit missing `exit 0` (double-JSON bug), state JSON injection via stored branch name
- `DEFAULT_REQUIRED` skill list synchronized across `stop-check.sh`, `completion-audit.sh`, and `prompt-reminder.sh`
- `forbidden` key documented in `silver-bullet.config.json.default`

### Changed
- Enforcement layer count: 7 → 10 (Stop hook, UserPromptSubmit reminder, forbidden-skill gate added)

## 0.6.2 (2026-04-04)

### Fixed
- Enforcement layer count aligned to 7 across all surfaces (README, landing page, concepts page, compare page, search index, SENTINEL audit)
- Step counts 19/23 → 20/24 on landing page hero pills, workflow tabs, and compare page
- Landing page workflow tables completed: added missing step 20 (/create-release) for dev cycle and steps 22-24 for DevOps cycle
- Landing page layer cards now match CLAUDE.md canonical 7-layer list (was missing Skill Tracker, had Stage Enforcer split into two)
- Layer ordering aligned to CLAUDE.md canonical sequence across concepts page, search index, and README
- PreToolUse → PostToolUse in landing page HARD STOP gate description
- Broken relative link in compare page footer (help/ → ../help/)
- Stale /tmp/ references in help reference page, search index, and silver:init skill
- Test files updated from /tmp/.silver-bullet-* to $HOME/.codex/.silver-bullet/ paths
- session-log-init sentinel subshell fully detached from pipeline (fixes test hangs)
- session-log-init grep pattern updated to match new mode file path
- SENTINEL audit doc updated: 8→7 layers, post-remediation note added
- context.md updated: stale step counts, version, and branding
- Missing Required badge on step 9 (/requesting-code-review) in dev cycle table
- Stale worktree .codex/worktrees/agent-ad2bff3d removed
- mkdir -p defense-in-depth added to completion-audit.sh
- Plugin boundary check changed from substring grep to prefix match

## 0.6.1 (2026-04-03)

### Fix: Comprehensive cross-file consistency audit
- Regenerated `.silver-bullet.json` from v0.2.0 template (was stuck at v0.1.0 with 13 obsolete skill names)
- Synced `CLAUDE.md` with `templates/CLAUDE.md.base` (7 enforcement layers, GSD/Superpowers ownership rules, file safety rules)
- Updated all 8 quality dimension skills (`modularity`, `reusability`, `scalability`, `security`, `reliability`, `usability`, `testability`, `extensibility`) from Superpowers-era references to GSD terminology
- Updated `forensics` skill reference from `superpowers:systematic-debugging` to `/gsd:debug`

### Enhanced: DevOps workflow parity
- Added Step 0 (SESSION MODE) to `devops-cycle.md` with pre-answer template
- Added SKILL DISCOVERY section with DevOps-specific examples
- Added MODEL ROUTING section before DISCUSS phase
- Added post-plan skill gap check to Step 6
- Added forensics failure protocol to Step 8 verification
- Added KNOWLEDGE.md, CHANGELOG.md, and session log to Step 18 finalization
- Added worktree isolation rule for docs agents to Step 18
- Added autonomous completion cleanup after Step 24

### Fix: Help site completeness
- Added DevOps Step 0, code review, and skill discovery sections to help page
- Added dev-workflow init (Steps 1–2) and post-review (Steps 11–12) to search index
- Added DevOps Step 0 and code review search entries
- Fixed duplicate `hooks` anchor for trivial-changes section in concepts page
- Added `whats-next` search entry for getting-started page

### Fix: Hook and config alignment
- Reordered `finalization_skills` in `dev-cycle-check.sh` to match `compliance-status.sh` and `completion-audit.sh`
- Bumped `plugin.json` and `package.json` descriptions to "20-step (app) and 24-step (DevOps)"
- Fixed `CHANGELOG.md` DevOps step count from 23 to 24

## 0.6.0 (2026-04-03)

### Fix: `/create-release` skill rename (critical)
- Renamed `skills/release-notes/` → `skills/create-release/` to fix naming collision with Claude Code 2.1.3's built-in `/release-notes` command, which was hijacking invocations and showing Claude Code's own changelog instead of Silver Bullet's release skill
- Updated 16+ references across hooks, workflows, templates, config files, README, CLAUDE.md, and all help site pages

### Enhanced: Review loop enforcement — double approval required
- Review loops (spec review, plan review, code review, verification) must now iterate until the reviewer returns ✅ Approved **twice in a row** — a single clean pass is no longer sufficient
- Completely self-limiting: loop ends naturally on two consecutive clean passes; maximum iteration cap removed
- Updated `CLAUDE.md`, `templates/CLAUDE.md.base`, `docs/workflows/full-dev-cycle.md`, `templates/workflows/*.md`, and help site

### Enhanced: CI gate hook is now blocking
- `hooks/ci-status-check.sh` now emits `blockToolUse: true` on CI failure — Claude must stop all other work immediately and invoke `/gsd:debug`
- Previously emitted only an advisory warning that could be ignored

### Enhanced: Expanded CI stack detection in `/silver:init`
- Detects and generates CI workflow templates for 8 additional stacks: Java/Maven, Java/Gradle, Ruby/RSpec, PHP/Composer, .NET/C#, Elixir/Mix, Swift, Dart/Flutter
- Go template updated to use `go-version: stable`

## 0.5.0 (2026-04-03)

### New: Semantic context compression
- New PostToolUse hook (`hooks/semantic-compress.sh`) that fires on GSD phase transitions and injects ranked context into the next prompt via `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`
- TF-IDF ranking of source and doc file chunks against the active phase goal — highest-relevance chunks are injected, lowest are dropped, keeping context tight
- Pure shell implementation (awk + sort) — no external dependencies beyond standard POSIX tools
- Cache-backed: MD5 hash of file mtimes + phase goal used as cache key; repeated calls within the same phase are instant
- Source files prioritised over doc files in ranking; configurable score weighting
- Configurable via `.silver-bullet.json` `semantic_compression` block (enable/disable, chunk size, max chunks injected, min score threshold, include/exclude globs)
- New scripts: `scripts/extract-phase-goal.sh`, `scripts/tfidf-rank.sh`, `scripts/semantic-compress.sh`
- 31 tests across 5 test suites covering TF-IDF scoring, caching, phase-goal extraction, hook wiring, and end-to-end integration

### New: Help site
- Full documentation site at sb.alolabs.dev — Getting Started, Core Concepts, Dev Workflow, DevOps Workflow, Command Reference
- Full-text search across all help content (TF-IDF JS index, ~50 entries)
- Nav search on all sub-pages
- Dark mode support

### Fixes
- Enforcement count corrected: 8 total enforcement points (Silver Bullet installs 6, GSD adds 2) — was described as 7
- DevOps quality gates dimension count: 7 IaC-adapted (usability excluded) — was incorrectly described as 8 in some places
- GSD install command updated to `npx get-shit-done-cc@^1.30.0` in all documentation
- README: hooks architecture updated to document all 9 hooks (4 enforcement + 4 support + session-start)
- README: Built-in skills table now lists all 7 Silver Bullet skills (was 3)
- Help reference: clarified which skills are Silver Bullet's own vs. from Superpowers/Engineering plugins

## 0.2.0 (2026-04-01)

### Major: GSD integration as primary execution engine
- GSD (get-shit-done) is now the primary skill set — fresh 200K-token context per agent, wave-based parallel execution, dependency graphs, atomic per-task commits
- Workflows restructured: GSD commands drive DISCUSS → PLAN → EXECUTE → VERIFY; Silver Bullet skills fill gaps (quality gates, code review, testing, docs, deploy)
- 8 individual quality gate skills collapsed into `/quality-gates` aggregate (individual files kept for modularity)

### New: DevOps workflow
- `devops-cycle.md` — 24-step workflow for infrastructure/DevOps work
- `/blast-radius` skill — pre-change risk analysis with LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL gate
- `/devops-quality-gates` skill — 7 IaC-adapted quality dimensions (usability excluded)
- Incident fast path for emergency production changes
- Environment promotion section (dev → staging → prod)
- `.yml`/`.yaml` files enforced as infrastructure code in devops-cycle

### New: Design plugin dependency
- Design plugin (anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins/design) added as required dependency
- Session-start hook injects Design plugin context alongside Superpowers

### New: Project type detection
- `/silver:init` Phase 2.6 asks application vs DevOps/infrastructure
- Sets `active_workflow` in config to `full-dev-cycle` or `devops-cycle`

### New: DevOps plugin integration
- `/devops-skill-router` skill — context-aware routing table mapping IaC toolchain + cloud provider to the best available plugin skill with fallback chains
- 5 optional DevOps plugins supported: hashicorp/agent-skills, awslabs/agent-plugins, pulumi/agent-skills, ahmedasmar/devops-claude-skills, wshobson/agents
- `/silver:init` Phase 2.7 auto-detects which DevOps plugins are installed
- `devops-cycle.md` contextual enrichment trigger points at DISCUSS, PLAN, EXECUTE, VERIFY, FINALIZATION
- `devops_plugins` section added to config for tracking installed plugins

### Hook updates
- All hooks updated to align with GSD-integrated workflow
- `record-skill.sh` — tracked skills list updated (removed GSD-replaced skills, added new skills)
- `dev-cycle-check.sh` — reads `active_workflow` from config; YAML files not auto-exempted in devops-cycle
- `compliance-status.sh` — phases updated: removed EXECUTION (now GSD), updated REVIEW and FINALIZATION skill lists
- `completion-audit.sh` — required deploy skills updated to match new workflow
- `deploy-gate-snippet.sh` — default required deploy skills updated

### Updated
- `full-dev-cycle.md` rewritten as 19-step GSD-primary workflow (down from 31)
- `CLAUDE.md.base` updated: 7 enforcement layers, trivial-change note clarifies DevOps YAML exception
- `silver-bullet.config.json.default` updated to v0.2.0 with new skill lists
- README rewritten for four-plugin ecosystem, two workflows, seven enforcement layers
- `plugin.json` updated to v0.2.0

## 0.1.0 (2026-03-31)

- Initial release

  - `/security` — OWASP top 10, input validation, secrets management, defense in depth
  - `/reliability` — fault tolerance, retries with backoff, circuit breakers, graceful degradation
  - `/usability` — intuitive APIs, actionable errors, progressive disclosure, accessibility
  - `/testability` — dependency injection, pure functions, test seams, deterministic behavior
  - `/extensibility` — open-closed principle, plugin architecture, versioned interfaces
- Six-layer compliance enforcement system
- `/silver:init` setup skill
- Superpowers + Engineering plugin dependency management
