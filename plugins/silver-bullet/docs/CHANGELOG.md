## 2026-06-11 — release-live-marker-host-state
**What**: Fixed the Kay/Codex live release runners so successful isolated runtime gates write their completion markers into the host Silver Bullet state directory that `completion-audit.sh` checks before `gh release create`.

**Virtual cost**: ~$0.08 (medium complexity - release blocker discovered during live matrix execution)

## 2026-06-11 — kay-live-hook-enforcement-release-fix
**What**: Hardened the Kay-backed Codex live hook bridge so denied before-hooks return a native block, fallback shims stay scoped to the active Kay hook path, repository write locks block direct `git commit` attempts, and Kay-style before/after hook IDs restore locks correctly.

**Skills run**: silver:ensure-docs
**Virtual cost**: ~$0.08 (low complexity — targeted static-site consistency scan and verification)
**KNOWLEDGE.md**: no changes

## 2026-06-09 — website-help-center-currentness-audit

## 2026-05-14 — sb-gsd-alignment

**Skills run**: SB+GSD alignment pass, quality-gate prep
**Virtual cost**: ~$0.45 (high complexity — hooks, skill contracts, docs, package sync, and tests)
**KNOWLEDGE.md**: updated (GSD artifact ownership, requested-vs-completed markers, plugin-specific release gates)

## 2026-05-10 — docs-surface-declutter
**What**: Collapsed overlapping documentation-scheme pages into compatibility wrappers, marked older verification and flow-parallelism design notes as historical snapshots, and simplified the knowledge index to point at the canonical doc-scheme contract.

## 2026-05-08 — doc-scheme-checklist-hard-gate
**What**: Upgraded doc-scheme enforcement from a trio-only check to a hard per-task checklist gate that now requires full governed-doc inventory coverage (all docs files plus root docs when present, with monthly wildcard keys) and validates `updated` entries against current-session file mtimes at both completion and delivery.
**Commits**: —
**Skills run**: silver-quality-gates, verification-before-completion
**Virtual cost**: ~$0.18 (medium complexity — hook logic + gate tests + docs contract updates)
