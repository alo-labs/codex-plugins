# Release Process

## Versioning Policy

- **Patch** (`v0.X.Y`): Bug fixes, doc updates, no enforcement changes
- **Minor** (`v0.X.0`): New features, new enforcement rules, new skills added to `required_deploy` (breaking — blocks existing users' commits until they invoke new required skills)
- **Major** (`vX.0.0`): Reserved for architectural changes

## Release Steps

### 1. Pre-Release Quality Gate (Mandatory)

Four stages must pass in the current session. See `docs/ENFORCEMENT.md` for details.

| Stage | Gate |
|-------|------|
| 1 | Code Review Triad — loop until zero issues |
| 2 | Big-Picture Consistency Audit — two clean passes |
| 3 | Public-Facing Content Refresh — all surfaces current |
| 4 | Security Audit (SENTINEL) — two clean passes |

Each stage requires `/superpowers:verification-before-completion` invocation. Markers cleared on session start.

### 2. Version Bump

Update `package.json` version field.

### 3. Changelog

Update the root `CHANGELOG.md` with features, fixes, and breaking changes. `docs/CHANGELOG.md` is the task log and is not the release notes surface.

### 4. Tag and Release

```bash
git tag vX.Y.Z
gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes "..."
```

Before the tag is created, the release commit must already be green. The
`silver:create-release` skill waits for `bash scripts/verify-release-commit-ci.sh`
and only then proceeds to `git tag` / `gh release create`. `completion-audit.sh`
blocks `gh release create` until all `required_deploy` skills, all 4 quality gate
stage markers, and the live matrix markers are present.
Run `bash scripts/run-release-live-matrix.sh` and
`tests/e2e-live/run-e2e-live-tests.sh` successfully in the current session
before creating the release tag. The
todo-app suite is now one inline full-surface journey and also writes an
`inline-e2e-matrix` marker so the end-user plugin bootstrap path and the
follow-on development flow are both proven before release.
The standard release gate now uses the Kay-backed Codex-compatible path only:
MiniMax.io + `MiniMax-M3` + low reasoning in isolated envs. Those
runs write `matrix=codex-only` markers, and those markers are the normal
release prerequisite. A full Claude/native-Codex matrix remains optional
diagnostic coverage only when explicitly requested.

### 5. Post-Release

Release closure is mandatory only after the following have succeeded:

- The published GitHub Release triggers `.github/workflows/announce-release.yml`
  and that workflow posts the release card into the `silver-bullet-updates`
  Google Chat thread.
- The reusable announcement prompt for other Ālo Labs plugins lives in
  `docs/internal/google-chat-release-announcement-prompt.md`.
- `bash scripts/post-release-refresh.sh` runs successfully and performs the clean
  uninstall + fresh reinstall cycle for both host runtimes from the published
  marketplaces:
  - Claude via `scripts/install-claude.sh --purge-legacy-plugins --public-release`
  - Codex via `scripts/install-codex.sh --purge-legacy-skills --public-release`
- Verify CI remained green on the release commit before the tag was created.
- Confirm plugin cache update works via `/silver:update`.
- Update site if needed (Stage 3 should have covered this).
- Keep the shared `alo-labs/claude-plugins` and `alo-labs/codex-plugins`
  marketplaces aligned with the SB package boundary whenever versioned wrappers
  change. Use `scripts/sync-release-marketplace-versions.sh` during release
  preparation so both repos stay in lockstep with the tagged release.

## Plugin Update Mechanism

Users update via `/silver:update` which:
1. Reads installed version from `$HOME/.codex/plugins/installed_plugins.json`
2. Resolves GitHub repo from `package.json` in the cache
3. Fetches latest release, compares versions
4. Clones new release into plugin cache
5. Updates registry entry (old cache preserved for rollback)

See `docs/internal/update-command-instructions.md` for full implementation guide.

## CI Pipeline

**File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — runs on every push and PR.

| Step | Validates |
|------|-----------|
| JSON validation | plugin.json, marketplace.json, hooks.json, config template, package.json |
| Hook executability | All hooks/*.sh and scripts/*.sh are chmod +x |
| hooks.json references | Every command in hooks.json points to existing file |
| Template placeholders | Required `{{...}}` tokens present in base files |
| Shell lint | ShellCheck on all hooks and scripts |

## Scalability

**Fixed** — process doc rewritten when release process changes. Not append-only.
