<!-- ENTRIES BELOW — newest first -->

## 2026-06-11 — release-live-marker-host-state
**What**: Fixed the Kay/Codex live release runners so successful isolated runtime gates write their completion markers into the host Silver Bullet state directory that `completion-audit.sh` checks before `gh release create`.
**Commits**: —
**Skills run**: silver:quality-gates, silver:review, silver:verify, verify-tests
**Virtual cost**: ~$0.08 (medium complexity - release blocker discovered during live matrix execution)
**KNOWLEDGE.md**: updated (host-state release markers for isolated runtime gates)
**Learnings**: updated (release tests must verify marker location, not just suite success)

## 2026-06-11 — kay-live-hook-enforcement-release-fix
**What**: Hardened the Kay-backed Codex live hook bridge so denied before-hooks return a native block, fallback shims stay scoped to the active Kay hook path, repository write locks block direct `git commit` attempts, and Kay-style before/after hook IDs restore locks correctly.
**Commits**: d442853
**Skills run**: silver:quality-gates, silver:review, silver:secure, verify-tests
**Virtual cost**: ~$0.24 (high complexity — live hook enforcement, isolation, targeted regression tests, full release verification)
**KNOWLEDGE.md**: updated (Kay hook bridge lock restoration, SB-only isolated runtime)
**Learnings**: updated (native deny plus fallback locks for runtimes with unreliable hook enforcement)

## 2026-06-10 — one-index-canonical-flows
**What**: Renumbered SB's canonical software engineering flows from the former zero-based catalog to `FLOW 1`-`FLOW 18` across the website, flow contracts, skill instructions, packaged sources, templates, hooks, and tests.
**Commits**: —
**Skills run**: silver:ensure-docs
**Virtual cost**: ~$0.16 (medium complexity — source-wide numbering migration and consistency tests)
**KNOWLEDGE.md**: no changes

## 2026-06-10 — website-content-consistency-scan
**What**: Scanned the public website content for stale or nonaligned claims and corrected comparison/SB-vs-GSD/workflow wording for host-neutral instruction files, monthly knowledge docs, helper-plugin orchestration, current release-gate scope, and the 18 canonical software engineering flows.
**Commits**: —
**Skills run**: silver:ensure-docs
**Virtual cost**: ~$0.08 (low complexity — targeted static-site consistency scan and verification)
**KNOWLEDGE.md**: no changes

## 2026-06-09 — website-help-center-currentness-audit
**What**: Audited the public website and Help Center against the current v0.37.22 implementation, removed stale research, release, session-startup, enforcement-count, and workflow-step claims, and aligned workflow, reference, and search content with current skill contracts.
**Commits**: —
**Skills run**: silver:ensure-docs
**Virtual cost**: ~$0.20 (medium complexity — full static-site audit, Help Center section pass, and targeted docs tests)
**KNOWLEDGE.md**: updated (research multi-AI exception)

## 2026-05-19 — v0.37.0-sdlc-interception-ledger
**What**: Extended Silver Bullet's orchestration contract for v0.37.0 with merged clarify behavior, SB-owned milestone bootstrap, a live active-intent ledger in session logs, and release-prep docs that keep the user-facing workflow aligned with the new SDLC interception model.
**Commits**: —
**Skills run**: silver:clarify, silver:init, silver:feature, verification-before-completion
**Virtual cost**: ~$0.40 (high complexity — hooks, docs, tests, and package sync)
**KNOWLEDGE.md**: updated (intent ledger coupling, request/completion consistency, release-prep orchestration)
**Learnings**: updated (request/completion coupling, dedup-safe ledger updates)

## 2026-05-14 — sb-gsd-alignment
**What**: Re-aligned Silver Bullet around GSD as the lifecycle authority, making SB the Agentic Process Orchestrator that composes pre-execution quality checks, GSD execution, and final delivery gates without blocking implementation on post-execution markers.
**Commits**: —
**Skills run**: SB+GSD alignment pass, quality-gate prep
**Virtual cost**: ~$0.45 (high complexity — hooks, skill contracts, docs, package sync, and tests)
**KNOWLEDGE.md**: updated (GSD artifact ownership, requested-vs-completed markers, plugin-specific release gates)

## 2026-05-10 — docs-surface-declutter
**What**: Collapsed overlapping documentation-scheme pages into compatibility wrappers, marked older verification and flow-parallelism design notes as historical snapshots, and simplified the knowledge index to point at the canonical doc-scheme contract.
**Commits**: —
**Skills run**: silver:ensure-docs, silver:init
**Virtual cost**: ~$0.10 (low complexity — docs cleanup and reference consolidation)
**KNOWLEDGE.md**: updated (canonical doc-scheme pointers, legacy wrapper guidance)

## 2026-05-08 — silver-ensure-docs-contract-gate
**What**: Implemented `/silver:ensure-docs`, delegated `/silver:init` docs bootstrap to it, switched hook enforcement to `docs/doc-scheme.json` contract gating at task granularities 2/3, and added brownfield switch archival policy (move to `docs/archive/` with traceability).
**Commits**: —
**Skills run**: silver:ensure-docs, silver:init, verification-before-completion
**Virtual cost**: ~$0.24 (medium complexity — hook refactor + contract + tests + routing/config updates)
**KNOWLEDGE.md**: updated (contract-driven checklist semantics, hook gap remediation path, archival move policy)

## 2026-05-08 — doc-scheme-checklist-hard-gate
**What**: Upgraded doc-scheme enforcement from a trio-only check to a hard per-task checklist gate that now requires full governed-doc inventory coverage (all docs files plus root docs when present, with monthly wildcard keys) and validates `updated` entries against current-session file mtimes at both completion and delivery.
**Commits**: —
**Skills run**: silver-quality-gates, verification-before-completion
**Virtual cost**: ~$0.18 (medium complexity — hook logic + gate tests + docs contract updates)
**KNOWLEDGE.md**: updated (doc gate contract, checklist semantics, stale-artifact test hardening)

## 2026-05-07 — codex-docs-coverage
**What**: Brought the project docs up to date with the current Codex packaging split, shared marketplace boundary, dual-runtime live matrix, and the May knowledge/learnings files.
**Commits**: —
**Skills run**: gsd:docs-update
**Virtual cost**: ~$0.12 (low complexity — docs sweep + verification)
**KNOWLEDGE.md**: updated (Codex packaging boundary, runtime matrix, project-instance artifact split)

## 2026-05-01 — fix-github-open-items
**What**: Patch release fixing hook enforcement gaps (#90 session-start ordering, #93 branch-write trailing newline, #95 tamper-guard regex), ShellCheck dead-variable warnings in stop-check.sh, stale skill/hook counts across docs and site, and SENTINEL security patches to silver-feature/SKILL.md (FINDING-1.1 shell-escaping advisory, FINDING-5.1 TOCTOU cleanup note).
**Commits**: 875bffc, cb06033, 1ec93b6 + prior phase 044 commits
**Skills run**: silver-quality-gates, engineering:code-review, security, anthropic-skills:audit-security-of-skill

**Commits**: —
**Skills run**: tdd, gsd-execute, gsd-plan, gsd-review, writing-plans
**Virtual cost**: ~$0.30 (MiniMax-M2.7, medium complexity)
**KNOWLEDGE.md**: updated (skills added to project)

## 2026-04-16 — trivial-session-bypass
**What**: Added trivial-session bypass to stop-check — SessionStart creates $HOME/.codex/.silver-bullet/trivial, PostToolUse Write/Edit/MultiEdit removes it; skill gate only fires when files were actually modified.
