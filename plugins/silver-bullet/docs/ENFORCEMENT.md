# Enforcement Architecture

Silver Bullet enforces workflow compliance through 12 independent layers. No single layer can be bypassed in isolation — they compose to provide defense-in-depth.

## The 12 Layers

| # | Layer | Mechanism | Fires On | What It Prevents |
|---|-------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Skill Recording** | `record-skill.sh` (PostToolUse) | Claude `Skill` tool calls and Codex `silver-bullet invoke-skill` receipts | Skills invoked through a supported channel but not tracked |
| 2 | **Dev Cycle Gate** | `dev-cycle-check.sh` (PreToolUse) | Edit, Write, MultiEdit, Bash | Code changes before planning is complete. Uses active `.planning/workflows/<id>.md` admission control first, then legacy skill markers when no composed workflow is active. |
| 3 | **Planning File Guard** | `planning-file-guard.sh` (PreToolUse) | Edit, Write, MultiEdit | Direct edits to SB-managed planning artifacts (ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, etc.); forces use of owning SB workflow |
| 4 | **Completion Audit** | `completion-audit.sh` (PostToolUse) | git commit/push/deploy/release | Shipping without required paths/skills. Uses `SB_WORKFLOW_ID`-matched `.planning/workflows/<id>.md` first, then legacy fallback when no composed workflow is active. |
| 5 | **CI Status Check** | `ci-status-check.sh` (PostToolUse) | git commit/push | Committing while CI is red |
| 6 | **Compliance Score** | `compliance-status.sh` (PostToolUse) | Every tool call | Silent progress — shows path progress (FLOW N/M) or skill count (legacy) |
| 7 | **Phase Archive** | `phase-archive.sh` (PreToolUse) | phase/archive commands | Data loss on milestone clear |
| 8 | **Stop Hook** | `stop-check.sh` (Stop/SubagentStop) | Task-complete declaration | Declaring done before required planning skills are in state |
| 9 | **Prompt Recorder + Reminder** | `record-requested-skill.sh` + `prompt-reminder.sh` (UserPromptSubmit) | Every user message | Requested SB routes and legacy aliases are recorded before the next turn; missing skills are re-injected |
| 10 | **Forbidden Skill Gate** | `forbidden-skill-check.sh` (PreToolUse/Skill) | Every Claude Skill invocation | Deprecated/forbidden skills (`executing-plans`, `subagent-driven-development`) |
| 11 | **ROADMAP Freshness Gate** | `roadmap-freshness.sh` (PreToolUse/Bash) | git commit | Committing SUMMARY.md without ticking the corresponding ROADMAP.md checkbox |
| 12 | **Redundant Instructions** | `silver-bullet.md` + optional project instruction file (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`, if present) | Every session | Same rules enforced across multiple surfaces for defense-in-depth |

## Dev Cycle Gate

`dev-cycle-check.sh` enforces pre-execution readiness. When an active `.planning/workflows/<id>.md` exists, the dev-cycle gate requires `SB_WORKFLOW_ID` admission before non-trivial source edits. The skill-based check is the legacy fallback for projects without a composed workflow.

| Stage | Requires | Blocks Until |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| A — Planning Floor | `required_planning` skills in state | SB pre-execution gates complete |
| B — Implementation Window | Planning floor complete | Source edits are allowed; review/verify/ship remain final-delivery gates |
| C — Review Recorded | `silver-review` in state | Source edits still allowed; finalization remains gated |
| D — Finalization | All `required_deploy` skills plus expected SB artifacts | Final delivery commands allowed |

## Composed-Workflow-First Enforcement Pattern

All hooks check active `.planning/workflows/<id>.md` files first, falling back to legacy skill markers when no composed workflow is active.

| Hook | Composed-Workflow Mode | Legacy Fallback |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `dev-cycle-check.sh` | Active workflow exists and `SB_WORKFLOW_ID` matches before non-trivial source edits | 4-stage skill marker check |
| `completion-audit.sh` | `SB_WORKFLOW_ID`-matched workflow file shows all required flow rows complete | `required_deploy` skill list check |
| `compliance-status.sh` | Shows path progress (FLOW N/M) | Shows skill count only |
| `prompt-reminder.sh` | Includes active composed workflow IDs and current position | Omits composition context |
| `spec-floor-check.sh` | Advisory when FLOW 5 excluded from composition | Hard gate always |

Detection: hooks check for `.planning/workflows/` existence and active `.md` files. Present = composed-workflow mode, absent = legacy mode.

## Skill Classification

| List | Purpose | Enforcement |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `all_tracked` | Discovery — hooks record invocation | Observability only |
| `required_deploy` | Hard gate — must be in state before shipping | `completion-audit.sh` blocks commit/push/release |

Current `required_deploy` (canonical source: `templates/silver-bullet.config.json.default`) includes SB quality gates, SB lifecycle markers (`silver-context`, `silver-plan`, `silver-execute`, `silver-verify`, `silver-ship`, review/security/validation), review framing, finalization, release creation, completion audit, TDD where applicable, and `verify-tests`. Legacy GSD/Superpowers marker names are accepted only as compatibility aliases during migration.

Conditional skills (NOT in `required_deploy`): `accessibility-review` (UI only), `incident-response` (DevOps only)

## Pre-Release Quality Gate (4-Stage)

Before any release, 4 stages must pass in the current session:

| Stage | What | Enforcement |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Code Review Triad | Loop until zero accepted issues |
| 2 | Big-Picture Consistency Audit | Two consecutive clean passes |
| 3 | Public-Facing Content Refresh | All user surfaces current |
| 4 | Security Audit (SENTINEL) | Two consecutive clean passes |

Each stage requires explicit SB completion evidence through `silver:completion-audit` or `silver:verify`, as appropriate for the stage. The quality-gate file is cleared on session start — no stale markers.

For the Silver Bullet plugin repo, the release live matrix wrapper (`scripts/run-release-live-matrix.sh`) and the todo-app live E2E suite (`tests/e2e-live/run-e2e-live-tests.sh`) are additional mandatory release prerequisites. Downstream projects use the generic release profile unless their `.silver-bullet.json` opts into plugin-runtime release matrices. The stage markers and the mandatory post-gate full-suite rerun marker live in `$HOME/.codex/.silver-bullet/quality-gate-state`. The full-suite rerun itself runs through `verify-tests`, which also writes `$HOME/.codex/.silver-bullet/verify-tests-state` so final delivery can detect stale source changes.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `SILVER_BULLET_STATE_FILE` | `$HOME/.codex/.silver-bullet/state` | Override the state file path used by all hooks. Intended for testing — lets test suites point hooks at a temp file instead of the real state. Must resolve to a path inside `$HOME/.codex/` (security guard enforced by `session-start.sh`). Paths outside `$HOME/.codex/` are rejected and fall back to the default. |
| `SILVER_BULLET_QUALITY_GATE_STATE_FILE` | `$HOME/.codex/.silver-bullet/quality-gate-state` | Override the release-quality-gate marker file used by `completion-audit.sh` and `session-start`. Intended for testing — lets test suites point hooks at a temp file instead of the real gate file. Must resolve to a path inside `$HOME/.codex/` (security guard enforced by `session-start`). Paths outside `$HOME/.codex/` are rejected and fall back to the default. |
| `SILVER_BULLET_VERIFY_TESTS_STATE_FILE` | `$HOME/.codex/.silver-bullet/verify-tests-state` | Override the test-execution freshness marker used by `completion-audit.sh`, `dev-cycle-check.sh`, `session-start`, and `/verify-tests`. Intended for testing — lets test suites point the gate at a temp file instead of the real freshness marker. Must resolve to a path inside `$HOME/.codex/` (security guard enforced by the hooks). Paths outside `$HOME/.codex/` are rejected and fall back to the default. |

## Bypass Detection

Silver Bullet detects and blocks:
- Out-of-order skill invocation (finalization before review)
- State file tampering (session-start validation)
- Hook skip attempts (hooks fire on every tool call, not just session start)
- Trivial-mode abuse (requires explicit user confirmation)

## Scalability

**Fixed** — this document describes structural layers that change only when enforcement architecture changes. Dual-mode hooks support both composed-workflow projects (`.planning/workflows/<id>.md`) and legacy projects (skill markers). Not append-only.
