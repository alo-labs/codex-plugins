# Architecture and Design

This document captures **high-level architecture and general design principles** only.
Detailed phase-level designs live in `docs/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`.

## System Overview

Silver Bullet is a Claude Code plugin (`.claude-plugin/`) composed of shell hook scripts,
skill markdown files, JSON configuration, and workflow documentation. It wraps the GSD,
Superpowers, Engineering, and Design plugins with an enforcement layer that prevents Claude
from skipping required workflow steps. No server, no database — all state lives in flat files
under `~/.claude/.silver-bullet/`.

## Core Components

| Component | Path | Responsibility |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| Hook scripts | `hooks/*.sh` | PostToolUse/PreToolUse enforcement — fire on every tool call |
| Skill files | `skills/*/SKILL.md` | Declarative workflow instructions loaded via the Skill tool |
| Workflow docs | `docs/workflows/` | Full per-session step-by-step procedures (active copies) |
| Templates | `templates/` | Bootstrap files copied during `/silver:init` setup |
| Config | `.silver-bullet.json` | Project-level list of tracked/required skills |
| State file | `~/.claude/.silver-bullet/state` | Flat file recording invoked skills in this session |
| Trivial flag | `~/.claude/.silver-bullet/trivial` | Touch-file that suspends enforcement for trivial changes |

### Key hooks

| Hook | Trigger | Behavior |
|------|---------|----------|
| `record-skill.sh` | PostToolUse (Skill tool) | Appends normalized skill name to state file |
| `dev-cycle-check.sh` | PreToolUse (Edit/Write/Bash) | 4-stage gate: blocks source edits if planning incomplete |
| `compliance-status.sh` | PostToolUse (all tools) | Emits live progress score per tool call |
| `completion-audit.sh` | PostToolUse (Bash) | Two-tier: blocks `git commit/push` if `required_planning` skills missing; blocks `gh pr create/deploy/gh release` if full `required_deploy` list missing |
| `planning-file-guard.sh` | PreToolUse (Edit/Write/MultiEdit) | Blocks direct edits to GSD-managed planning artifacts (ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, etc.); requires the owning GSD skill instead |
| `ci-status-check.sh` | PostToolUse (Bash) | Warns on commit/push if CI is failing |
| `stop-check.sh` | Stop / SubagentStop | Requires `required_planning` skills (planning floor) before session ends; skipped when `trivial` file exists. Full `required_deploy` is enforced by `completion-audit.sh` at delivery commands |
| *(hooks.json entry)* | SessionStart | Creates `~/.claude/.silver-bullet/trivial` — marks every new session trivial by default |
| *(hooks.json entry)* | PostToolUse (Write\|Edit\|MultiEdit) | Removes `~/.claude/.silver-bullet/trivial` — clears trivial flag when files are modified |

### Trivial-Session Bypass

The trivial bypass is a touch-file mechanism that allows enforcement hooks to stand down for
non-code-producing sessions. The file lives at `~/.claude/.silver-bullet/trivial`.

**Lifecycle:**
1. **Session start** — `SessionStart` hook creates the file unconditionally. Every session begins as "trivial" (no dev work assumed).
2. **First file edit** — `PostToolUse` on Write/Edit/MultiEdit removes the file. The session is now marked as a dev session; enforcement activates.
3. **Session end** — `stop-check.sh` checks: if the file exists, skips the skill checklist (non-dev session). If absent, enforces `required_planning` skills.

**Which hooks check the trivial file:**
- `stop-check.sh` — skips skill checklist
- `ci-status-check.sh` — skips CI failure block
- `completion-audit.sh` — skips planning completeness gate

**Manual escape hatch:**
If the bypass file was removed (because a file was edited) but you need to commit without full workflow compliance (e.g. committing a CI fix), recreate it in your terminal:
```bash
touch ~/.claude/.silver-bullet/trivial
```
The file will be cleared again on the next file edit, so the bypass is temporary.

**Security:**
The hooks validate that the trivial file is a regular file (`-f`) and not a symlink (`! -L`) before honoring it, preventing symlink-based bypass attacks.

## Design Principles

1. **Never modify third-party plugins.** All enforcement is additive to the host project.
2. **12 layers, no single bypass.** Enforcement survives context window resets because hooks
   re-fire on every tool call, not just at session start.
3. **User instructions always take precedence.** `CLAUDE.md` user rules override SB defaults.
4. **Non-destructive file operations.** Hooks are read-only except for the state/mode files they
   own. Setup commands create new files; update mode overwrites only `silver-bullet.md`.
5. **Flat-file state.** No process, no daemon, no server. State is a text file. Any tool that
   writes to it or reads from it can be independently audited.
6. **Template parity.** `templates/workflows/` must remain byte-identical to `docs/workflows/`
   so new projects get the same enforcement rules as the current project.

## Technology Choices

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Language | Bash | Pure Bash hooks and scripts; `jq` for JSON parsing (no Node.js runtime required) |
| Config format | JSON | Machine-readable by hooks and CI; human-readable for customization |
| Skill format | Markdown | Loaded natively by Claude Code's Skill tool |
| State format | Line-delimited text | `grep -q` lookups; append-only; trivially auditable |
| CI | GitHub Actions | Target audience is GitHub repos; `gh` CLI integrates release workflow |
