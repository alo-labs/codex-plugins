# Prior-Art and Adjacent-Landscape Research: Silver Bullet APO Architecture

**Research Date:** 2026-06-26
**Researcher:** opencode (mimo-v2.5-pro)
**Scope:** Existing tools, frameworks, methodologies, papers, and products overlapping with Silver Bullet's Agentic Process Orchestrator (APO) architecture.

---

## 1. Executive Summary (≤300 words)

Silver Bullet occupies a **distinct architectural niche** that no existing tool fully covers. The closest competitors combine 2-3 of SB's 7 differentiators, but none combine all of them.

**Closest direct matches:** MetaGPT (multi-agent SDLC with SOP-based role orchestration), CrewAI (composable flows + crews with task guardrails), and LangGraph (graph-based workflow composition with human-in-the-loop interrupts). Each covers ~3-4 SB dimensions but lacks critical elements: MetaGPT has no dynamic composition or V-model verification; CrewAI has guardrails but no per-step V-loop rollup or hook-enforced lifecycle chains; LangGraph has graph composition and interrupts but no SDLC workflow catalog or evidence model.

**Biggest gaps in the market:**
1. **No existing tool combines machine-readable workflow catalog + per-step V-loop rollup + hook-enforced lifecycle chains.** This is SB's strongest differentiator.
2. **No tool unifies SE lifecycle AND DevOps/infra paths in one APO model.** Existing tools are either SE-focused (MetaGPT, SWE-agent) or DevOps-focused (Argo, Temporal).
3. **No tool has catalog-backed audited dynamic composition** — where runtime decisions to prune/insert/substitute flows are logged with catalog rationale. LangGraph has dynamic routing but no audit trail tied to a catalog.
4. **Evidence tiers and tool governance** (mandatory when relevant, with staleness rules) appear nowhere in the landscape.

**Adjacent inspirations:** Temporal's durable execution model, OPA's policy-as-code enforcement, Claude Code's hook system, and Anthropic's "Building Effective Agents" workflow patterns all offer mechanisms SB could borrow or integrate with.

**Negative results:** No credible "agentic process orchestrator" combining ≥3 SB differentiators was found. The BMAD Method and GSD (Get Shit Done) could not be verified as existing open-source projects with inspectable code — GitHub searches returned no results under those names. The term "APO" is not used in the existing literature; "workflow orchestration" and "multi-agent framework" are the closest established categories.

    url: https://github.com/FoundationAgents/MetaGPT
    quote2: "MetaGPT encodes Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) into prompt sequences for more streamlined workflows, thus allowing agents with human-like domain expertise to verify intermediate results."
    url2: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00352
```

## 5. Top 5 Adjacent Inspirations

### 1. Temporal — Durable Execution
**What SB could borrow:** Activity retry policies, durable execution (crash recovery via replay), signal-based external input. SB's hook-based approach could be replaced or augmented with Temporal-style durable execution for long-running orchestrations.

### 2. OPA — Policy-as-Code
**What SB could borrow:** Rego policy language for tool governance. Decision logs for audit trail. Bundle distribution for policy updates. SB's tool_policies could be expressed as OPA policies.

### 3. Claude Code — Hook System
**What SB could borrow:** Claude Code's hook lifecycle (pre-commit, post-commit, etc.) is more mature than SB's shell-script hooks. The CLAUDE.md memory system is more user-friendly. Sub-agent delegation via Task tool.

### 4. Anthropic "Building Effective Agents" — Patterns
**What SB could borrow:** Orchestrator-workers pattern, evaluator-optimizer pattern, routing pattern. These are proven production patterns that SB could formalize in its catalog.

### 5. Earthly Lunar — Natural Language → Deterministic Enforcement
**What SB could borrow:** Converting AGENTS.md / cursor rules / checklists into deterministic PR enforcement. More accessible than SB's hook-based system for non-technical team members.

---

## 6. Negative Results

### Categories searched where nothing credible was found:

1. **BMAD Method:** GitHub search for "bmad method", "bmad workflow", "bmad agents" returned zero repos. Domain `bmadmethod.com` does not resolve. The only hit was `edouard-claude/bmad2vibe` — a converter tool, not the method itself. **Conclusion:** Either the BMAD Method does not exist as an open-source project, or it uses a different name/platform not discoverable via GitHub search.

2. **GSD (Get Shit Done):** GitHub search for "GSD get shit done agent orchestration" returned zero results. **Conclusion:** Not an existing open-source project under this name.

3. **Superpowers AI:** GitHub search for "superpowers AI agent workflow" returned zero results. **Conclusion:** Not an existing open-source project under this name.

4. **"V-model" + "LLM agents" papers:** No papers found describing implementable V-model verification for LLM agent workflows. The closest is MetaGPT's intermediate verification, which is per-phase, not per-step with rollup.

5. **"Process orchestration" + "software engineering agents":** No papers or tools found combining process orchestration (as SB defines it) with software engineering agents. The terms are used independently.

6. **"Hook-enforced skill chains":** No tools found with this concept. Claude Code has hooks, but they're not organized as enforced skill chains.

7. **"Evidence sufficiency" + "agent artifact verification":** No tools found with tiered evidence sufficiency models tied to agent outputs.

8. **Windsurf Cascades:** No detailed documentation found on Windsurf's cascade system. The product exists (Codeium's IDE) but the cascade architecture is not publicly documented.

## 7. Open Research Questions

1. **Is the BMAD Method a real project?** Could not verify. May be a proprietary/internal methodology, a different platform (not GitHub), or a name change. Needs human investigation.

2. **Microsoft Agent Framework:** AutoGen's successor. Not publicly documented yet (as of Jun 2026). May be the most direct competitor when it ships.

3. **Temporal + LLM agents integration:** Temporal is marketing to AI agent builders (OpenAI, Lovable, Replit, Cursor use it). How does Temporal's durable execution compare to SB's hook-based orchestration for SDLC workflows?

4. **Claude Code hooks maturity:** How mature is Claude Code's hook system in production? Can it enforce the kind of lifecycle chains SB requires?

5. **Cursor rules enforcement:** Cursor's `.cursorrules` file provides soft enforcement. Is there a hard enforcement mechanism? Documentation was sparse.

6. **Earthly Lunar details:** Lunar claims to convert AGENTS.md into deterministic enforcement. How does this work technically? Is it comparable to SB's hook system?

7. **Camunda for agent orchestration:** BPMN is designed for human+system workflows. Has anyone adapted it for LLM agent orchestration? No evidence found.

8. **Argo Workflows for SDLC:** Argo is DevOps-focused. Has anyone used it for SE lifecycle workflows? No evidence found.

**Silver Bullet target scores: 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 = 16/16**

**Top 3 by total:** Camunda (7), MetaGPT (4), CrewAI (4), Argo (4), Harness (4)

**Note:** Camunda scores highest because it's a mature BPMN engine with catalog (BPMN model), per-phase gates, policy enforcement, parent/worker split, and artifact-based evidence. However, it's not designed for LLM agents — it's a traditional business process engine. MetaGPT and CrewAI are the closest *agent-specific* competitors.

## 9. Dedup Notes

- **AutoGen vs AG2:** AutoGen is the canonical name. The README explicitly states it's in maintenance mode and recommends Microsoft Agent Framework.
- **Codium-ai/pr-agent vs Qodo-ai/pr-agent:** Same project, renamed. PR-Agent is now under Qodo brand.
- **geekan/MetaGPT vs FoundationAgents/MetaGPT:** Same project, moved to FoundationAgents org.
- **bmad-sim/BMAD-METHOD:** Could not verify. Multiple URL patterns tried, all 404.
- **Earthly (build tool) vs Earthly Lunar (guardrails):** Different products from same company. Earthly (build) is shutting down; Lunar (guardrails) is the new focus.

## 10. Methodology Limitations

1. **Web fetch only — no runtime inspection.** Could not run any of these tools. Classification based on docs/repos only.
2. **BMAD Method and GSD could not be verified.** May exist on non-GitHub platforms or under different names.
3. **Closed-source products** (Cursor internals, Devin, Codeium/Windsurf) — classified from public docs only.
4. **No academic paper full-text reads.** Abstracts and metadata only for arXiv papers.
5. **Date sensitivity.** All data gathered 2026-06-26. Rapidly evolving landscape.
