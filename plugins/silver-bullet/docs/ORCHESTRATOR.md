# Silver Bullet Orchestrator Contract

**Status:** Parent-only orchestration (2026-06-14)

Silver Bullet's orchestrator sequences lifecycle work through **directives**, **Task workers**, and **hooks**. The parent session NEVER implements directly — cooperative single-agent mode is removed.

## Execution model

| Role | Session | May implement? | Tools |
|------|---------|----------------|-------|
| **Parent** | Main agent / `/silver` | **No** | Task, Read, Grep, Glob; Skill: `silver` / `silver-orchestrator` only |
| **Worker** | Task subagent per atomic flow | **Yes** (after assigned skill) | Full tool surface per flow contract; **invoke** (not merely read) the assigned skill |

On tier-2 hosts the parent **spawns Task workers**; workers **invoke** flow-atom skills so hooks record state.

**Tier 0–1 hosts** (no Task/subagent support or hooks not merged): invoke the same skill sequence **directly** in a single session — read `docs/RUNTIME-COMPATIBILITY.md` §Tier 0–1 playbook. Parent-only directive blocks apply only when tier ≥ 2 and `orchestrator_mode` is `parent`.

Config: `"orchestrator_mode": "parent"` (only allowed value; default in template).

## State surfaces

| File | Scope | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `$HOME/.codex/.silver-bullet/orchestrator.json` | Session/branch | Intent, `flow_queue`, `current_flow`, `workflow_id` |
| `$HOME/.codex/.silver-bullet/orchestrator-directive.json` | Session/branch | **Mandatory next skill** + `next_worker_template` when `blocking: true` |
| `$HOME/.codex/.silver-bullet/orchestrator-intent.txt` | Session | Latest user intent (first line) |
| `$HOME/.codex/.silver-bullet/orchestrator-worker-active.json` | Session | Parent Task spawn handoff metadata |
| `$HOME/.codex/.silver-bullet/orchestrator-events.jsonl` | Session | Durable append-only orchestration event log (dispatch, join, advance, stop_block, saga) |
| `$HOME/.codex/.silver-bullet/orchestrator-saga.json` | Session | Active ship/deploy saga ledger + rollback hints |
| `$HOME/.codex/.silver-bullet/enterprise-human-deploy-approved` | Session | Human sign-off marker when enterprise policy blocks production delivery |
| `.scheduler.batch_dispatch` (in `orchestrator.json`) | Session | Active parallel/sequential batch handoffs + join status |
| `.silver-bullet/orchestrator-workers/*.md` | Project | Worker prompt templates (stamped by `silver:init`) |
| `.planning/orchestrator-composition-log.jsonl` | Committed | Autonomous composition audit |
| `.planning/orchestrator-override-log.jsonl` | Committed | User `SB OVERRIDE:` audit trail |

## Directive schema (`orchestrator-directive.json`)

```json
{
  "next_skill": "silver-quality-gates",
  "next_worker_template": "QUALITY-GATE",
  "args": "optional intent snippet",
  "reason": "human-readable why",
  "blocking": true,
  "updated_at": "2026-06-14T12:00:00Z"
}
```

When the catalog scheduler groups multiple dependency-ready atoms into one batch, `batch_dispatch` is added (shell hooks cannot spawn host Task workers — the parent reads this and spawns workers):

```json
{
  "batch_dispatch": {
    "batch_index": 0,
    "dispatch_mode": "parallel",
    "host_parallel_capable": true,
    "status": "pending_dispatch",
    "handoffs": [
      {
        "atomic_flow_id": "AF-ORIENT",
        "next_skill": "silver-context",
        "next_worker_template": "ORIENT",
        "dispatch_status": "pending",
        "join_status": "pending"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Hosts without multitask/subagent support (`SB_ORCHESTRATOR_PARALLEL_DISPATCH=0` or tier &lt; 2) get `dispatch_mode: "sequential"` — only the first pending handoff is surfaced via `next_skill` while join gates still apply.

**Parent Task spawn (required on tier ≥ 2):** Shell hooks **cannot** invoke the host `Task` tool. When `blocking: true` and `batch_dispatch` is present, the **parent session must spawn Task workers** (one per pending handoff on parallel-capable hosts). `stop-check.sh` blocks parent Stop until handoffs are dispatched and joined. Reading the directive alone does not satisfy the contract — only recorded worker skill invocation + join state advance the queue.

**Batch join gate:** When `.scheduler.batch_dispatch` has unjoined handoffs, `sb_orchestrator_advance_on_atom` records `last_completed` but **does not** advance `current_flow` or overwrite the batch directive until every handoff in the active batch joins. Sequential behavior is unchanged when scheduler state is absent. Handoff join matching resolves skills through `migration_map` (`runtime_queue_tokens`, `skill_to_entity`, `gsd_alias_to_entity`), `FLOW-*` normalization, and slug fallbacks (`hooks/lib/orchestrator-skill-atom.sh`).

## Parent loop

```
User intent → /silver or silver-orchestrator
  → composer spec seeds orchestrator.json + workflows.sh
  → directive: next_skill + next_worker_template
  → parent **must spawn Task** with `.silver-bullet/orchestrator-workers/<TEMPLATE>.md` (hooks cannot spawn)
  → worker invokes next_skill → implements flow
  → SubagentStop clears worker marker
  → flow-advance writes next directive
  → repeat until queue empty
```

## Worker contract

Each worker template (`templates/orchestrator-workers/`) includes:

- Flow contract reference (`docs/composable-flows-contracts.md`)
- Mandatory skill invocation
- Acceptance criteria and handoff artifacts

Workers should run with `SB_ORCHESTRATOR_WORKER=1` (set in Task prompt) so hooks apply worker directive-guard semantics. Ship/deploy workers should call `sb_orchestrator_saga_begin` / `sb_orchestrator_saga_complete` (via scheduler event-log helpers) so rollback hints are durable on failure.

## Enterprise policy runtime (Phase B+D)

When `enterprise_policy.active_profile` is set in `.silver-bullet.json`:

| Field | Runtime consumer |
|-------|------------------|
| `clarify_auto` | `session-start` injects `/silver:clarify --auto` hint |
| `evidence_schema_strict` | `completion-audit` delivery gate strictness (with `hooks.evidence_schema.strict`) |
| `production_deploy_requires_human` | Blocks `gh pr create`, `gh release create`, `deploy` unless `$HOME/.codex/.silver-bullet/enterprise-human-deploy-approved` exists |
| `non_production_deploy_autonomy` | Allows staging/non-prod deploy commands when profile permits (e.g. `internal_dogfood`) |

## Durable event log + resume

| API (`hooks/lib/orchestrator-event-log.sh`) | Purpose |
|--------------------------------------------|---------|
| `sb_orchestrator_event_record_*` | Append dispatch/join/advance/stop_block/retry/saga events |
| `sb_orchestrator_event_resume_hints_json` | Crash/resume snapshot from `orchestrator.json` + event tail |
| `sb_orchestrator_event_apply_resume_checkpoint` | Restore scheduler `active_batch_index` from last dispatch event |
| `sb_orchestrator_saga_rollback_hint` | Minimal rollback guidance for ship/deploy workers |

## Enforcement (tier ≥ 2)

| Hook | Parent behavior | Worker behavior |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `orchestrator-directive-guard.sh` | Blocks Edit/Write/Bash; allows Task; blocks direct flow Skill | Blocks until `next_skill` recorded |
| `stop-check.sh` | Blocks Stop while `current_flow` pending **or** scheduler batch dispatch/join pending (blocked join gates, undispatched handoffs, failed step V-loops) | SubagentStop clears worker marker |
| `prompt-reminder.sh` | Injects directive + parent mode banner | Injects directive |
| `session-start` | Parent mode context | Worker when `SB_ORCHESTRATOR_WORKER=1` |

### Cursor / tier 0–1

Guidance only — `templates/cursor-rules/silver-orchestrator.mdc` + directive injection. Tier 2+ required for mechanical parent blocks.

## Host modes — Plan & Debug (E2E-013)

Silver Bullet hooks do **not** read host mode from stdin today. Operators and agents should treat modes as follows:

| Host mode | Parent may | SB enforcement |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **Agent (default)** | Spawn Task workers; read-only Bash in parent | Full PreToolUse/Stop stack |
| **Plan** (`SwitchMode` → plan) | Read/Grep/Glob + Task PLAN worker; **no** direct Edit/Write in parent | `orchestrator-directive-guard` still blocks parent writes; route planning via workers |
| **Debug** | Route to `silver:debug` / `silver:forensics` queue — not freestyle Bash | Stop/PreToolUse still fire; use `SB OVERRIDE:` only for audited bypass |
| **Ask** | Read-only tools | Aligns with parent read-only subset |

**Enterprise E2E:** Matrix rows run in autonomous Agent mode. Do not switch to Plan/Debug mid-row — outcome scorers expect worker completion markers.

**Future:** SessionStart may inject `SB PLAN MODE` context when hosts expose mode hints reliably.

## SubagentStop semantics

- **Worker SubagentStop:** Clears `orchestrator-worker-active.json`; does not block (parent continues).
- **Parent Stop:** Blocked while orchestrator queue has pending `current_flow` **or** scheduler runtime work remains (pending batch handoffs, dispatched-but-unjoined workers, blocked join gates, failing step V-loops) — parent must spawn next Task worker(s) per `orchestrator-directive.json` `batch_dispatch`.

### Skill recording from workers

Workers must invoke assigned flow skills through the host's SB-recognized channel (`Skill` tool, `scripts/silver-bullet invoke-skill`, or equivalent) so `PostToolUse/Skill or Codex invoke-skill receipt` → `record-skill.sh` appends markers to `$HOME/.codex/.silver-bullet/state`. Parent Task spawns do not auto-record skills — the worker invocation does. If delivery gates report missing skills after a worker completed, verify the worker used a recorded channel rather than reading the skill file inline.

## Migration

Existing projects:

```bash
bash scripts/sb-migrate-orchestrator-parent.sh [project-root]
```

Sets `orchestrator_mode: parent`, copies worker templates and Cursor rule.
