# Security Posture

**Last updated:** 2026-04-13
**Methodology:** SENTINEL adversarial security audit (4-stage pre-release gate)

## Current Posture

Silver Bullet has passed 5 SENTINEL audit cycles across v0.7.0, v0.8.0, and v0.15.0 releases. All Critical and High findings have been remediated. The audit is mandatory — Stage 4 of the pre-release quality gate blocks releases until two consecutive clean passes.

### Threat Model Summary

| Threat | Mitigation | Layer |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Prompt injection via CLAUDE.md | Hook scripts fire on every tool call — instructions can't override hooks | Hooks |
| Skill skip (bypass enforcement) | `completion-audit.sh` blocks git operations if required skills missing from state | Hook gate |
| State file tampering | `~/.claude/.silver-bullet/state` is append-only; session-start clears stale markers | State mgmt |
| Hook bypass via direct file edit | `dev-cycle-check.sh` blocks Edit/Write/Bash if planning phase incomplete | Pre-tool gate |
| Trivial-mode abuse | Trivial flag requires explicit user confirmation; auto-cleared on session start | UX gate |
| Cross-plugin conflict | SB never modifies third-party plugin files; additive enforcement only | Design principle |
| Stale quality gate markers | Session-start hook clears all `quality-gate-stage-*` markers | Session lifecycle |

### Hardening History

| Version | Key Changes |
|---------|-------------|
| v0.7.0 | Initial 7-layer enforcement, SENTINEL P-1 through P-7 |
| v0.8.0 | Skill enforcement expansion (TDD, tech-debt promoted to required_deploy) |
| v0.8.0-pass2 | Forensics skill hardening, bypass detection |
| v0.15.0 | Artifact reviewer 2-pass framework, cross-artifact consistency |
| v0.16.0 | Configurable review depth, review analytics |

## Scalability

This document is a **snapshot** — rewritten each release with current posture. Historical audits live in `docs/audits/` (one file per audit, never modified after creation). Cap: max 20 audit files; oldest removed when exceeded (findings are in git history).
