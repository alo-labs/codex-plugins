# Pre-Release Quality Gate

Before ANY release (`/silver-create-release`), the following four-stage quality gate MUST
be completed in order. Each stage has its own completion criteria. Skipping a stage
or declaring it complete without meeting the criteria is a violation.

> **MANDATORY — 2 Consecutive Clean Rounds:** Each stage that uses a review or audit loop
> MUST achieve **2 consecutive clean rounds** before the stage is considered complete.
> A "clean round" means all active review or audit steps produced zero accepted findings.
> This requirement applies to Stage 1 (code review loop), Stage 2 (consistency audit loop),
> and Stage 4 (security audit loop). Do NOT advance to the next stage or proceed to release
> until 2 consecutive clean rounds are confirmed for each applicable stage.

**IMPORTANT**: This gate runs AFTER the normal workflow finalization steps (testing,
documentation, branch cleanup, deployment readiness) and BEFORE `/silver-create-release`.
The `/silver-create-release` skill will not be invoked until all four stages pass.

## Stage 1 — Code Review (FLOW 10: SB Review Stack)

Runs SB's FLOW 10 code-review structure against the release candidate
(see `docs/composable-flows-contracts.md` §FLOW 10). SB owns the authoritative
`REVIEW.md`, review request framing, findings triage, and fix loop. The stage
iterates until **2 consecutive clean passes across the active review stack**.

### Review stack

Each review pass produces findings -> triages via `silver:review-triage` ->
applies fixes through the owning SB workflow. Cross-AI review is optional and
only supplements the SB review artifact.

| Step | Skill | Role | Triage | Fix |
|------|-------|------|--------|-----|
| 1 (Always for this release gate) | `silver:review-request` | Frames the review scope, files, risks, and blockers | n/a | n/a |
| 2 (Always) | `silver:review` | Authoritative SB review artifact -> `REVIEW.md` | `silver:review-triage` | Owning SB workflow |
| 3 (As-needed) | external second-opinion review | Optional adversarial peer review when architecturally significant or user-requested | `silver:review-triage` | Owning SB workflow |

### Execution

1. **Frame the review.** Invoke `silver:review-request` so the
   active runtime states scope, files, and risks before reviewers run.
2. **Run SB review.** Invoke `silver:review` and treat its `REVIEW.md` as
   the authoritative review artifact.
3. **Optional adversarial review.** Use an external second-opinion reviewer only
   when the release is architecturally significant or the user requests cross-AI review.
4. **Triage.** Run `silver:review-triage` against each review
   output that contains findings. Do NOT merge findings before triage — each
   reviewer frame stays intact through its own triage pass.
5. **Fix.** Apply accepted findings through the owning SB workflow
   (atomic commits per coherent fix). Non-accepted findings with rationale go to
   `REVIEW.md` notes.
6. **Backlog capture.** Before starting the next round, any low-priority /
   deferred / advisory findings not fixed in this round MUST be filed via
   `silver:add` or the configured local backlog — do not silently drop them.
7. **Round boundary.** A "clean round" = all active review steps produced zero
   accepted findings in that round.
8. **Loop**: run rounds until **2 consecutive clean rounds across all active
   review steps**. Match the review cycle discipline used in Stages 2 and 4.
9. **MANDATORY — invoke `/silver:completion-audit` or `/silver:verify`** through
   the active runtime's SB-recognized skill invocation channel. Running
   verification commands manually is NOT a substitute for invoking the SB
   completion gate. You need BOTH: (a) run the actual
   verification commands (tests, CI status, lint), AND (b) invoke the SB skill
   so `record-skill.sh` tracks it.

### Retro-audit mode

When this gate runs retroactively against an already-shipped release (no
release candidate to fix), the active review stack still runs for findings, but the
"fix and loop until 2 clean rounds" cycle is replaced by **"file every
accepted finding as a backlog item for the next patch release"**. Stage
markers are NOT recorded in retro-audit mode — the markers are reserved for
gating a live release candidate. The user must declare retro-audit mode
explicitly at the start of the gate.

## Stage 2 — Big-Picture Consistency Audit

Review the entire plugin for cross-file inconsistencies, redundancies, and contradictions.

1. Dispatch parallel Explore agents across five dimensions:
   - **Workflows**: full-dev-cycle.md vs devops-cycle.md vs CLAUDE.md vs silver-bullet.md
   - **Skills**: all SKILL.md files — obsolete references, redundant work, contradictions
   - **Hooks + config**: .sh files, hooks.json, .silver-bullet.json, templates
   - **Help site + README**: HTML pages, search.js, README.md — step counts, paths, versions
   - **Absorbed dependency consistency**: check SB lifecycle skills, hooks,
     templates, installers, README, and site copy for contradictions or
     lingering hard dependencies on absorbed GSD/Superpowers/Anthropic
     knowledge-work skills
2. Fix all genuine issues found
3. **Loop**: repeat until two consecutive audit passes find zero issues
4. **MANDATORY — invoke `/silver:completion-audit` or `/silver:verify`** through the active runtime's SB-recognized skill invocation channel.

---

## Stage 3 — Public-Facing Content Refresh

Verify and update all user-visible surfaces to reflect the current state.

1. Audit for factual accuracy:
   - GitHub repo description and topics (`gh repo edit`)
   - README.md (version, step counts, enforcement layers, state paths, architecture)
   - Landing page (`site/index.html`)
   - All help pages (`site/help/*/index.html`)
   - Search index (`site/help/search.js`)
   - Compare page (`site/compare/index.html`) if it exists
2. Fix all discrepancies
3. **MANDATORY — invoke `/silver:completion-audit` or `/silver:verify`** through the active runtime's SB-recognized skill invocation channel.
4. Push and confirm CI green

---

## Stage 4 — Security Audit (SENTINEL)

Run the SENTINEL v2.3 adversarial security audit against the full plugin.

1. Invoke the SB security audit path targeting the plugin root
2. Fix all findings (Critical, High, Medium; Low at discretion)
3. Re-run the audit
4. **Loop**: repeat until two consecutive audit passes find zero issues
5. **MANDATORY — invoke `/silver:completion-audit` or `/silver:verify`** through the active runtime's SB-recognized skill invocation channel.

---

## Mandatory Full Test Suite Rerun

After all four stages pass in the current session, rerun the full test suite
before release finalization:

1. Run `/verify-tests`
2. Record the rerun marker: `echo "full-test-suite-rerun" >> $HOME/.codex/.silver-bullet/quality-gate-state`
3. Do not invoke `/silver-release` until both the rerun marker and the `/verify-tests` freshness marker are present

`hooks/completion-audit.sh` blocks release creation until the quality-gate file
contains the four stage markers plus `full-test-suite-rerun`, and the
`/verify-tests` freshness marker is still present.

---

## Enforcement

Each stage is enforced via mandatory SB completion evidence from
`/silver:completion-audit` or `/silver:verify`. When invoked, it is recorded in the state file
(`$HOME/.codex/.silver-bullet/state`); `hooks/completion-audit.sh` tracks required skill
invocations to gate `gh release create`. The stage completion markers and the
full-suite rerun marker live in `$HOME/.codex/.silver-bullet/quality-gate-state`.

**Session reset:** The `session-start` hook clears the Silver Bullet quality-gate file at
the beginning of every session. Each release cycle must earn its own gate pass in
the current session.

> **Anti-Skip:** You are violating this rule if you release without running all 4 stages
> in the CURRENT session and rerunning the full test suite afterward. Each stage requires
> explicit SB completion-audit or verification invocation — running verification
> commands manually is NOT a substitute.

## Live Matrix Release Gate

Before `gh release create` or `/silver-create-release`, the release live matrix
wrapper and the todo-app live E2E suite must run successfully in the current
session:

1. Run `bash scripts/run-release-live-matrix.sh`
2. Run `tests/e2e-live/run-e2e-live-tests.sh`
3. Confirm the standard isolated Kay/OpenCode Go/DeepSeek V4 Flash low path passes in each suite
4. Let each runner create its session-scoped marker

`hooks/completion-audit.sh` blocks release creation until both markers exist.
Before the tag is created, run `bash scripts/verify-release-commit-ci.sh` and
wait for the release commit's `CI` and `Secret Scan` runs to complete
successfully. The release must not be published while that commit is still
running or failing.

The default runners now write `matrix=codex-only` markers because the release
gate is defined on the Kay-backed Codex-compatible runtime. Those markers are
the normal release prerequisite. A broader full Claude/native-Codex parity run
is still accepted when explicitly requested, but it is no longer required to
cut a release.

Optional Cursor smoke (install, hook merge, diagnostics, cursor hook unit tests;
no live Cursor agent session): `bash scripts/release-live-matrix-cursor-smoke.sh`
writes `matrix=cursor-smoke` when enabled. CI runs this smoke path on every push.

If any stage surfaces a blocker that cannot be resolved (e.g., upstream dependency
issue, ambiguous design decision), log it under "Needs human review" and surface
to the user before proceeding to the next stage.
