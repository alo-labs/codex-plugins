## Contract Schema

Every flow contract contains these 7 required fields:

| Field | Description |

| **Prerequisites** | Artifacts that MUST exist before this flow runs |
| **Trigger** | Context signals that cause /silver to include this flow |
| **Steps** | Ordered skill invocations — mandatory vs as-needed |

| **GSD Impact** | Which GSD state fields are read/written |
| **Exit Condition** | What makes this flow "complete" |
