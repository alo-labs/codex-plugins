# /silver:bugfix — Bug, Regression, Test Failure Workflow

SB orchestrator for bugs, regressions, crashes, errors, and failing tests. Enforces triage-first discipline: classify the failure type before any investigation begins.

Never implements fixes directly — orchestrates only.

## Pre-flight: Load Preferences

Read the **User Workflow Preferences** section of `silver-bullet.md` to load user workflow preferences before any other step.

```bash
grep -A 50 "^## [0-9]\+\. User Workflow Preferences" silver-bullet.md | head -60
```

Symptom: {$ARGUMENTS or "(not specified)"}
```

## Composition Proposal

Before beginning execution, read existing artifacts to determine context and propose which PATHs to include or skip.

### 1. Context Scan

Check the following artifacts and set skip/include flags:

| Artifact | Signal | Action |
|----------|--------|--------|
| `.planning/` directory exists | Project already bootstrapped | Skip FLOW 0 (BOOTSTRAP) |
| `.planning/STATE.md` exists | GSD state present | Skip FLOW 0 (BOOTSTRAP) |

```bash
# Check for existing planning artifacts
[ -d ".planning" ] && echo "SKIP FLOW 0 — .planning/ exists" || echo "Include FLOW 0"
```

### 2. Build Path Chain

Construct the proposed flow chain for bugfix triage. Bugfix is single-phase by design — no per-phase loop. Default chain:

FLOW 1 (ORIENT) → FLOW 14 (DEBUG) [always included — this is a bugfix] → FLOW 5 (PLAN) → FLOW 7 (EXECUTE) → FLOW 11 (VERIFY) → FLOW 13 (SHIP)

Note: FLOW 14 (DEBUG) is always included for any bugfix engagement. FLOW 0 (BOOTSTRAP) is skipped when `.planning/` already exists.

### 3. Display Proposal

Display the composition proposal to the user:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SILVER BULLET ► FLOW COMPOSED                                │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Flows: ORIENT → DEBUG → PLAN → EXECUTE → VERIFY → SHIP       │
│ Skipped: BOOTSTRAP — .planning/ exists                       │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
Approve composition? [Y/n]
```

### 4. Auto-Confirm in Autonomous Mode

In autonomous mode (§10e), auto-confirm the composition proposal with a log message:

```
⚡ Autonomous mode: auto-confirming composition — {path count} paths, {skipped count} skipped
```

### 5. Start workflow tracking (Pass 2 — workflows.sh)

Invoke `scripts/workflows.sh start` to register this composition as an active workflow.
The helper writes a per-instance file to `.planning/workflows/<id>.md` and returns the
workflow id. Capture it and export it as `SB_WORKFLOW_ID` so all child shells (including
`gh release create` / `gh pr create`) inherit it — completion-audit's strict gate uses
this to verify the active workflow is fully complete before final delivery.

```bash
# Build a comma-separated flow list from the confirmed composition (use the
# user-facing FLOW / PATH names so they match what compliance-status surfaces).
SB_FLOWS="<flow1>,<flow2>,..."   # filled in from the confirmed chain

SB_WORKFLOW_ID=$(scripts/workflows.sh start /silver:bugfix "the bug description ($ARGUMENTS)" "$SB_FLOWS")
export SB_WORKFLOW_ID
echo "Workflow tracker started: $SB_WORKFLOW_ID"
```

After each flow / path completes, mark it done:

```bash
scripts/workflows.sh complete-flow "$SB_WORKFLOW_ID" "<flow-name>"
```

When the entire composition finishes (after the final SHIP / RELEASE flow lands), close
the workflow:

```bash
scripts/workflows.sh complete "$SB_WORKFLOW_ID"
```

`complete` archives the file under `.planning/workflows/.archive/<id>.md` and removes
it from the active set, so the strict final-delivery gate will not match a stale id.

> **Legacy:** the v0.22 single-file `.planning/WORKFLOW.md` mechanism is retired. The
> per-instance `.planning/workflows/<id>.md` files are the only workflow tracker as of
> v0.29.1.

After each path completes, the helper updates the Flow Log row in-place — Claude does
not edit the file directly.


## Step-Skip Protocol

When the user requests skipping any step:
1. Explain why the step exists (one sentence)
2. Offer: A. Accept skip  B. Lightweight alternative  C. Show me what you have
3. If user chooses A permanently: record in silver-bullet.md §10b and templates/silver-bullet.md.base §9b, commit both.

**Non-skippable gates:** `silver:security`, `silver:silver-quality-gates` pre-ship, `gsd-verify-work`.

## Step 0: Triage — Classify Failure Type

Use AskUserQuestion:

> What best describes this failure?
>
> A. Known symptom, unknown fix — I can observe the bug but don't know the root cause
> B. Unknown cause — session history is unclear, need to reconstruct what happened
> C. Failed GSD workflow specifically — a plan, execution phase, or GSD command failed

Wait for selection, then route to the corresponding path below.

## Path 1A: Known Symptom, Unknown Fix

Invoked when: triage selects A, OR after Path 1B/1C silver-forensics completes and hands off here.

**1A.1 — Systematic debugging hypothesis**
Invoke `superpowers:systematic-debugging` via the Skill tool. Purpose: structure the debugging hypothesis before executing investigation — ensures systematic approach before diving into code.

**1A.2 — Persistent debugging investigation**
Invoke `gsd-debug` via the Skill tool. Purpose: execute investigation with persistent state across context resets.

After gsd-debug completes, proceed to Step 2 (TDD).

## Path 1B: Unknown Cause, Needs Reconstruction

Invoked when: triage selects B.

**1B.1 — Forensic cause reconstruction**
Invoke `silver:silver-forensics` via the Skill tool. Purpose: SB-owned silver-forensics skill (skills/silver-forensics/SKILL.md) — reconstructs cause from git history, artifacts, and state. Outputs a cause classification report.

After silver:silver-forensics completes and outputs the cause classification:
→ Hand off to Path 1A (start at Step 1A.1 with the reconstructed context).

## Path 1C: Failed GSD Workflow

Invoked when: triage selects C.

**1C.1 — GSD-specific post-mortem**
Invoke `gsd-forensics` via the Skill tool. Purpose: GSD-owned post-mortem for failed GSD workflows (failed plans, broken state, incomplete phases). Outputs diagnosis.

After gsd-forensics completes and outputs diagnosis:
→ Hand off to Path 1A (start at Step 1A.1 with the GSD diagnosis context).

## Step 2: TDD — Write Regression Test First

All paths converge here. Before writing any fix code:

Invoke `silver:tdd` (superpowers:test-driven-development) via the Skill tool. Purpose: write a failing regression test first — RED must appear before writing any fix. This ensures the fix is verifiable and the bug cannot silently regress.

**Enforcement:** Do not proceed to Step 3 until the test is red (failing for the right reason).

## Step 3: Plan the Fix

Invoke `gsd-plan-phase` via the Skill tool (lightweight, 1-2 tasks only — this is a fix, not a feature).

## Step 4: Execute Fix + Verify Green

Invoke `gsd-execute-phase` via the Skill tool. After execution, verify the regression test from Step 2 is now green.

## Step 5: Code Review

Run the full review sequence in order:

1. Invoke `silver:request-review` (superpowers:requesting-code-review) via the Skill tool.
2. Invoke `/code-review` via the Skill tool. Purpose: establish review criteria before spawning reviewer agents.
3. Invoke `gsd-code-review` via the Skill tool.
4. Invoke `silver:receive-review` (superpowers:receiving-code-review) via the Skill tool.

## Step 6: Verify Work

Invoke `gsd-verify-work` via the Skill tool. Purpose: confirm fix, zero regression. Non-skippable.

## Step 7: Security Review

Invoke `silver:security` via the Skill tool. Non-skippable.

## Step 7a: Tech Debt Review

Invoke `/tech-debt` via the Skill tool. Purpose: identify and document any technical debt introduced by the fix. Items not addressed now MUST be captured via `/silver-add`.

### Deferred-Item Capture (mandatory)

During and after execution, any item that is skipped, descoped, out of scope, explicitly deferred, or identified for future work MUST be filed immediately via `/silver-add` — do not accumulate silently.

```
Skill(skill="silver-add", args="<description of deferred item>")
```

**Classification quick-reference:**
- Bug, regression, broken behavior, blocking question, unfinished work → files as **issue**
- Feature request, tech debt, advisory finding, informational question, housekeeping → files as **backlog**
- When ambiguous → files as **backlog** (do not over-alarm with issues)

**Minimum bar:** Only file items with distinct impact OR that block future work OR represent a conscious deferred decision. Do not file transient notes or items already addressed this session.

## Step 7b: Quality Gates

Invoke `silver:silver-quality-gates` via the Skill tool (affected quality dimensions for the changed code). Non-skippable.

## Step 7c: Doc-Scheme Compliance (conditional)

**Only if `docs/doc-scheme.md` exists in the project:**

```bash
[ -f "docs/doc-scheme.md" ] && echo "Doc-scheme gate required" || echo "No doc-scheme — skip"
```

Before raising the PR, verify documentation is up to date per the scheme:

1. **`docs/CHANGELOG.md`** — must have an entry for this fix (newest-first). If missing, write it now.
2. **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — update §Current State if the fix changed any architectural constraints.
3. **`docs/knowledge/YYYY-MM.md`** (current month) — if root-cause patterns or API gotchas were discovered, append them.
4. **`docs/lessons/YYYY-MM.md`** (current month) — if portable lessons were learned during diagnosis, append them.

**Gate:** Do NOT proceed to Step 8 until all applicable checks pass.

If no `docs/doc-scheme.md` exists: skip this step entirely and proceed to Step 8.

## Step 8: Ship

Invoke `gsd-ship` via the Skill tool. Purpose: push branch, create PR.
