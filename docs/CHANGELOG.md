<!-- ENTRIES BELOW — newest first -->

## 2026-05-01 — fix-github-open-items
**What**: Patch release fixing hook enforcement gaps (#90 session-start ordering, #93 branch-write trailing newline, #95 tamper-guard regex), ShellCheck dead-variable warnings in stop-check.sh, stale skill/hook counts across docs and site, and SENTINEL security patches to silver-feature/SKILL.md (FINDING-1.1 shell-escaping advisory, FINDING-5.1 TOCTOU cleanup note).
**Commits**: 875bffc, cb06033, 1ec93b6 + prior phase 044 commits
**Skills run**: silver-quality-gates, engineering:code-review, security, anthropic-skills:audit-security-of-skill
**Virtual cost**: ~$0.60 (Sonnet, high complexity — 4-stage pre-release gate + silver-release)
**KNOWLEDGE.md**: no changes

## 2026-04-24 — forge-sb-skill-test-harness
**What**: Created comprehensive test harness for all 60+ forge-sb skills using todo app as realistic development scenario
**Commits**: —
**Skills run**: tdd, gsd-execute, gsd-plan, gsd-review, writing-plans
**Virtual cost**: ~$0.30 (MiniMax-M2.7, medium complexity)
**KNOWLEDGE.md**: updated (skills added to project)

## 2026-04-16 — trivial-session-bypass
**What**: Added trivial-session bypass to stop-check — SessionStart creates ~/.claude/.silver-bullet/trivial, PostToolUse Write/Edit/MultiEdit removes it; skill gate only fires when files were actually modified.
**Commits**: 7848b92
**Skills run**: silver-quality-gates, security, gsd-docs-update, silver-release
**Virtual cost**: ~$0.15 (Sonnet, low complexity)
**KNOWLEDGE.md**: no changes

## 2026-04-16 — engineering-skills-restoration
**What**: Restored Anthropic Engineering plugin skill invocations missing from composable flows; fixed stop-check and completion-audit hooks to treat required_deploy config as sole source of truth.
**Commits**: 405f683, 4fcadce, 4eb2a11, 3717b93, 197015b
**Skills run**: silver-quality-gates, requesting-code-review, receiving-code-review, security, test-driven-development, verification-before-completion, silver-create-release
**Virtual cost**: ~$0.40 (Sonnet, low-medium complexity)
**KNOWLEDGE.md**: no changes

## 2026-04-16 — backlog-maintenance-sweep
**What**: Implemented 17 backlog items (999.1–999.18): CI assertions, hook fixes, test additions, skill ordering correction in silver-release, and deferred-item capture enforcement across composable flows.
**Commits**: acd4bdc, 242caf5, e3c2f93, 7997079, 79614d4, 184e249, c2adf5a, cab7ca1, b368dac, 4319a30, 4d35e81, b47974d, 00c20c0, 2cbb599, 4800963, 31b23e9, ed37723
**Skills run**: silver-quality-gates, requesting-code-review, receiving-code-review, security, test-driven-development, verification-before-completion, silver-create-release
**Virtual cost**: ~$2.40 (Sonnet, high complexity — autonomous multi-item sweep across hooks, tests, CI, docs)
**KNOWLEDGE.md**: no changes

## 2026-04-05 — skill-enforcement-expansion
**What**: Promoted four gap-filling skills to explicitly enforced workflow gates in both full-dev-cycle and devops-cycle workflows.
**Commits**: e9647be, ec1b1ac, fc327ca, cae7b6e, 26a893f, cfb93d1, 7da4df6, af5397f, 842d523, 5bf169c, bab5598, 56072bd, 3aa218d
**Skills run**: quality-gates, test-driven-development, code-review, requesting-code-review, receiving-code-review, testing-strategy, tech-debt, documentation
**Virtual cost**: ~$1.20 (Sonnet, complex — 3 review passes, 2 plans, multiple doc updates)
**KNOWLEDGE.md**: updated (architecture patterns, known gotchas, key decisions, recurring patterns, open questions)
