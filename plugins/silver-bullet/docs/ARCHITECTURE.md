# Architecture and Design

This document captures **high-level architecture and general design principles** only.
Detailed phase-level designs live in `docs/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`.

## System Overview

Silver Bullet ships two first-class plugin surfaces: a Claude Code plugin (`.codex-plugin/`)
and a Codex bundle (`plugins/silver-bullet/`). Both are composed of shell hook scripts, slash-command
markdown files, skill markdown files, JSON configuration, and workflow documentation. SB wraps GSD
as the lifecycle authority and calls Superpowers, Engineering, Design, and other helper plugins only
at explicit workflow-selected boundaries. Its enforcement layer prevents the runtime from skipping
required workflow steps.

Claude packaging remains the canonical host-integrated surface. The Codex bundle is SB-only and
is synchronized from the repo root. Third-party plugins that do not publish Codex artifacts are
represented by thin wrappers in the shared `alo-labs/codex-plugins` marketplace, which fetches
upstream content at install time instead of vendoring it here.

No server, no database — all state lives in flat files under `$HOME/.codex/.silver-bullet/`.

## Core Components

| Component | Path | Responsibility |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| Hook scripts | `hooks/*.sh` | PostToolUse/PreToolUse enforcement — fire on every tool call |
| Skill files | `skills/*/SKILL.md` | Declarative workflow instructions loaded through the active runtime's SB-recognized skill invocation channel |
| Workflow docs | `docs/workflows/` | Full per-session step-by-step procedures (active copies) |
| Commands | `commands/` | `/silver:*` slash-command wrappers shipped inside the SB Codex bundle |
| Templates | `templates/` | Bootstrap files copied during `/silver:init` setup |
| Codex bundle | `plugins/silver-bullet/` | Curated SB-only Codex package snapshot, refreshed from the repo root |
| Codex installer | `scripts/install-codex.sh` | Registers the shared Codex marketplace and bootstraps official dependencies |
| Shared Codex marketplace | `https://github.com/alo-labs/codex-plugins` | Thin wrappers for third-party plugins that lack native Codex packaging |
| Live runtime matrix | `tests/live/` | Shared Claude/Codex E2E harness with runtime adapters |
| Config | `.silver-bullet.json` | Project-level list of tracked/required skills |
| State file | `$HOME/.codex/.silver-bullet/state` | Flat file recording invoked skills in this session |
| Trivial flag | `$HOME/.codex/.silver-bullet/trivial` | Legacy compatibility marker. Codex agents should route trivial work through `/silver:fast` instead of using the touch-file bypass. |

### Key hooks

| Hook | Trigger | Behavior |
|------|---------|----------|
| `record-skill.sh` | PostToolUse (Claude Skill calls or Codex SB adapter receipts) | Appends normalized skill name to state file |
| `record-requested-skill.sh` | UserPromptSubmit | Records requested SB/GSD route markers before the next turn starts |
| `dev-cycle-check.sh` | PreToolUse (Edit/Write/Bash) | 4-stage gate: blocks source edits if planning incomplete |
| `compliance-status.sh` | PostToolUse (all tools) | Emits live progress score per tool call |
| `completion-audit.sh` | PostToolUse (Bash) | Two-tier: blocks `git commit/push` if `required_planning` skills missing; blocks `gh pr create/deploy/gh release` if full `required_deploy` list missing |
| `planning-file-guard.sh` | PreToolUse (Edit/Write/MultiEdit) | Blocks direct edits to GSD-managed planning artifacts (ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, etc.); requires the owning GSD skill instead |
| `ci-status-check.sh` | PostToolUse (Bash) | Warns on commit/push if CI is failing |
| `prompt-reminder.sh` | UserPromptSubmit | Re-injects missing skills list before every user message and surfaces current workflow context |
| `stop-check.sh` | Stop / SubagentStop | Requires `required_planning` skills (planning floor) before session ends. Full `required_deploy` is enforced by `completion-audit.sh` at delivery commands |
| *(hooks.json entry)* | SessionStart | Clears any stale `$HOME/.codex/.silver-bullet/trivial` marker at session start; does not auto-create it |
| *(hooks.json entry)* | PostToolUse (Write\|Edit\|MultiEdit) | Clears `$HOME/.codex/.silver-bullet/trivial` when files are modified |

### Fast Path

Silver Bullet routes trivial changes through `/silver:fast`, which classifies the change
and dispatches to `gsd-fast` without the full workflow overhead. The legacy touch-file
marker remains only as a compatibility detail for older sessions, not as the supported
Codex entry point.

## Design Principles

1. **Never modify third-party plugins.** All enforcement is additive to the host project.
2. **12 layers, no single bypass.** Enforcement survives context window resets because hooks
   re-fire on every tool call, not just at session start.
3. **User instructions always take precedence.** Any existing project instruction file (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`) overrides SB defaults, but SB does not require one to exist.
4. **Non-destructive file operations.** Hooks are read-only except for the state/mode files they
   own. Setup commands create new files; update mode overwrites only `silver-bullet.md`.
5. **Flat-file state.** No process, no daemon, no server. State is a text file. Any tool that
   writes to it or reads from it can be independently audited.
6. **Template parity.** `templates/workflows/` must remain byte-identical to `docs/workflows/`
   so new projects get the same enforcement rules as the current project.
7. **Packaging boundaries.** SB-owned plugin bundles never vendor dependency plugins or project
   instance artifacts. The Codex bundle stays SB-only; dependency plugins are installed from
   their official sources, and non-native Codex support lives in the shared marketplace.

### Packaging Boundaries

- `/.planning/`, `/.codex/`, and `/.forge/` are project-instance artifacts, not plugin content.
- `silver-bullet.md` is the project copy; `templates/silver-bullet.md.base` is the source template.
- `plugins/silver-bullet/` is a curated Codex snapshot, not a mirror of the whole repository.
- `commands/` ships inside the SB bundle so Codex sees one Silver Bullet plugin, not a split command plugin.
- Third-party Codex wrappers belong in the shared marketplace and fetch upstream content at install time.

## Technology Choices

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Language | Bash | Pure Bash hooks and scripts; `jq` for JSON parsing (no Node.js runtime required) |
| Config format | JSON | Machine-readable by hooks and CI; human-readable for customization |
| Skill format | Markdown | Loaded through the active host's skill surface; Codex mirrors SB skills into the native `/Silver:` picker and records via the SB adapter |
| State format | Line-delimited text | `grep -q` lookups; append-only; trivially auditable |
| CI | GitHub Actions | Target audience is GitHub repos; `gh` CLI integrates release workflow |
| Codex packaging | Thin wrapper + install-time fetch | Keeps SB bundle SB-only while supporting third-party plugins that lack native Codex packaging |
