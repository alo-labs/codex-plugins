# Pre-Release Quality Gate

Before ANY release (`/create-release`), the following four-stage quality gate MUST
be completed in order. Each stage has its own completion criteria. Skipping a stage
or declaring it complete without meeting the criteria is a violation.

**IMPORTANT**: This gate runs AFTER the normal workflow finalization steps (testing,
documentation, branch cleanup, deploy checklist) and BEFORE `/create-release`.
The `/create-release` skill will not be invoked until all four stages pass.

## Stage 1 — Code Review (FLOW 9: Three-Layer Parallel)

Runs SB's FLOW 9 code-review structure against the release candidate
(see `docs/composable-flows-contracts.md` §FLOW 9). Three independent review
layers run in parallel; each layer has its own triage + fix sub-cycle; the
overall stage iterates until **2 consecutive clean passes across all layers**.

### Layer structure

Each layer produces findings → triages via `superpowers:receiving-code-review`
→ applies fixes via `gsd-code-review-fix`. All three always run. Layer D is
conditional.

| Layer | Reviewer skill | Frame | Triage | Fix |
|-------|---------------|-------|--------|-----|
| A (Always) | `gsd-code-review` | SB automated reviewer agents → `REVIEW.md` | `superpowers:receiving-code-review` | `gsd-code-review-fix` |
| B (Always) | `superpowers:requesting-code-review` (dispatches `superpowers:code-reviewer`) | Peer quality review via subagent | `superpowers:receiving-code-review` | `gsd-code-review-fix` |
| C (Always) | `engineering:code-review` | Structured review: security, performance, correctness, maintainability | `superpowers:receiving-code-review` | `gsd-code-review-fix` |
| D (As-needed) | `gsd-review --all` | Cross-AI adversarial peer review — required when change is architecturally significant or user requests it. `--all` fans out to every available CLI (Gemini, Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Qwen, Cursor). | `superpowers:receiving-code-review` | `gsd-code-review-fix` |

### Execution

1. **Parallel dispatch.** For each round, invoke Layers A, B, C (and D when
   triggered). Sequential invocation is acceptable per D-65 — true Agent-tool
   parallelism is an optimization, not a gate requirement.
2. **Per-layer triage.** After each layer produces findings, run
   `superpowers:receiving-code-review` against that layer's output. Do NOT
   merge findings across layers before triage — each reviewer's frame stays
   intact through its own triage pass.
3. **Per-layer fix.** Apply accepted findings via `gsd-code-review-fix`
   (atomic commits per finding). Non-accepted findings with rationale go to
   `REVIEW.md` notes.
4. **Backlog capture.** Before starting the next round, any low-priority /
   deferred / advisory findings not fixed in this round MUST be filed via
   `gsd-add-backlog` — do not silently drop them.
5. **Round boundary.** A "clean round" = all 3 (or 4) layers produced zero
   accepted findings in that round.
6. **Loop**: run rounds until **2 consecutive clean rounds across all active
   layers**. Match the review cycle discipline used in Stages 2 and 4.
7. **MANDATORY — invoke `/superpowers:verification-before-completion`** via
   the Skill tool. Running verification commands manually is NOT a substitute
   for invoking the skill. You need BOTH: (a) run the actual verification
   commands (tests, CI status, lint), AND (b) invoke the skill so
   `record-skill.sh` tracks it. If you ran checks but did not invoke the
   skill, you have NOT completed this step.

### Retro-audit mode

When this gate runs retroactively against an already-shipped release (no
release candidate to fix), Layers A/B/C still run for findings, but the
"fix and loop until 2 clean rounds" cycle is replaced by **"file every
accepted finding as a backlog item for the next patch release"**. Stage
markers are NOT recorded in retro-audit mode — the markers are reserved for
gating a live release candidate. The user must declare retro-audit mode
explicitly at the start of the gate.

## Stage 2 — Big-Picture Consistency Audit

Review the entire plugin for cross-file inconsistencies, redundancies, and contradictions.

1. Dispatch parallel Explore agents across five dimensions:
   - **Workflows**: full-dev-cycle.md vs devops-cycle.md vs CLAUDE.md vs silver-bullet.md
   - **Skills**: all SKILL.md files — obsolete references, redundant work, contradictions
   - **Hooks + config**: .sh files, hooks.json, .silver-bullet.json, templates
   - **Help site + README**: HTML pages, search.js, README.md — step counts, paths, versions
   - **Cross-plugin consistency**: read 100% of skill content from all 4 dependency plugins —
     GSD: `~/.claude/get-shit-done/` workflows/references/templates;
     Superpowers: `~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/superpowers/*/skills/*/SKILL.md`;
     Engineering: `~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/knowledge-work-plugins/*/engineering/skills/*/SKILL.md`;
     Design: `~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/knowledge-work-plugins/*/design/skills/*/SKILL.md` —
     check for contradictions, conflicts, inconsistencies, or redundancies between Silver Bullet
     instructions and upstream plugin skills
2. Fix all genuine issues found
3. **Loop**: repeat until two consecutive audit passes find zero issues
4. **MANDATORY — invoke `/superpowers:verification-before-completion`** via the Skill tool.

---

## Stage 3 — Public-Facing Content Refresh

Verify and update all user-visible surfaces to reflect the current state.

1. Audit for factual accuracy:
   - GitHub repo description and topics (`gh repo edit`)
   - README.md (version, step counts, enforcement layers, state paths, architecture)
   - Landing page (`site/index.html`)
   - All help pages (`site/help/*/index.html`)
   - Search index (`site/help/search.js`)
   - Compare page (`site/compare/index.html`) if it exists
2. Fix all discrepancies
3. **MANDATORY — invoke `/superpowers:verification-before-completion`** via the Skill tool.
4. Push and confirm CI green

---

## Stage 4 — Security Audit (SENTINEL)

Run the SENTINEL v2.3 adversarial security audit against the full plugin.

1. Invoke `/anthropic-skills:audit-security-of-skill` targeting the plugin root
2. Fix all findings (Critical, High, Medium; Low at discretion)
3. Re-run the audit
4. **Loop**: repeat until two consecutive audit passes find zero issues
5. **MANDATORY — invoke `/superpowers:verification-before-completion`** via the Skill tool.

---

## Enforcement

Each stage is enforced via the mandatory `/superpowers:verification-before-completion`
skill invocation. When invoked, it is recorded in the state file
(`~/.claude/.silver-bullet/state`); `hooks/completion-audit.sh` tracks required skill
invocations to gate `gh release create`.

**Session reset:** The `session-start` hook clears the state at the beginning of every
session. Each release cycle must earn its own gate pass in the current session.

> **Anti-Skip:** You are violating this rule if you release without running all 4 stages
> in the CURRENT session. Each stage requires explicit `/superpowers:verification-before-completion`
> invocation — running verification commands manually is NOT a substitute.

If any stage surfaces a blocker that cannot be resolved (e.g., upstream dependency
issue, ambiguous design decision), log it under "Needs human review" and surface
to the user before proceeding to the next stage.
