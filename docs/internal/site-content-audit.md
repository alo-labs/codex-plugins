# Silver Bullet Website Content Audit
## Gap Analysis: Site vs. Current Plugin (v0.13.0)

**Audit Date:** April 8, 2026  
**Plugin Version Audited:** v0.13.0  
**Site Last Updated:** April 7, 2025 (1 year old)  
**Audit Scope:** Full comparison of all website pages against current README.md, silver-bullet.md (§0-10), and 7 new orchestration skills

---

## Executive Summary

The Silver Bullet website is **significantly outdated**. The plugin has undergone a massive architectural revamp, adding 7 new orchestration skills, comprehensive user preferences system (§10), expanded /silver router, security hardening, and multi-step session initialization. The site content represents v0.12.x (roughly) and is missing ~30% of current functionality and ~50% of new enforcement features.

**Scope of Changes:**
- 7 new orchestration skills completely missing from site
- §2h (SB Orchestrated Workflows) routing table and orchestration descriptions missing
- §10 (User Workflow Preferences) system completely missing
- /silver router complexity triage and disambiguation tables missing
- §0 session startup auto-update checks missing
- §2g bare instruction interception missing
- SENTINEL v0.13.0 security hardening (§1, verification-before-completion) missing
- silver:update skill not documented
- MultAI integration references missing

**Estimated Scope:** 12-15 new/updated pages required; ~4,000-5,000 words of new content.

## Implementation Checklist

### Before Starting Content Creation
- [ ] Verify all sections of current silver-bullet.md (§0-10) are understood
- [ ] Review all 7 orchestration skill SKILL.md files for accurate step descriptions
- [ ] Audit .silver-bullet.json config options in README and plugin code
- [ ] List all new enforcement hooks and their descriptions
- [ ] Extract SENTINEL v2.3 security changes and hardening details
- [ ] Identify all new skill references (/silver:update, /verification-before-completion, etc.)

### Content Standards
All new pages should:
- Use consistent HTML structure from existing pages
- Include breadcrumb navigation
- Have both light and dark mode CSS (already defined in existing pages)
- Include sidebar navigation where applicable
- End with page-nav-bottom (Previous/Next/Up links)
- Include footer with links
- Pass accessibility checks (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Have descriptive meta tags and title
- Be optimized for site search (search.js)

### Search Index Updates
After creating new pages, update:
- `site/help/search.js` — add new page titles and keywords to index

### Version Updates
Update version references throughout:
- Site footer/header (if version is displayed)
- README.md mention of "Current version"
- Any release notes or what's new section

---

## Risk Assessment

**Risk: Content Drift**
The plugin continues to evolve. This audit captures state as of April 8, 2026. Any plugin updates after this date may invalidate sections.

**Mitigation:** 
- Schedule quarterly content audits
- Link to plugin README directly for installation/setup (less maintenance)
- Use version numbers in page headers (e.g., "Valid for Silver Bullet v0.13.0+")

**Risk: Inconsistency with Plugin Docs**
Website content may diverge from silver-bullet.md or SKILL.md files over time.

**Mitigation:**
- Establish a rule: every plugin update must trigger a docs audit
- Include a "Last verified against" line in help pages (e.g., "Last verified: silver-bullet.md §0-10 as of April 8, 2026")
- Add a feedback mechanism on help pages ("Is this page accurate?")

---

## Conclusion

The Silver Bullet website is in urgent need of a major content refresh. The plugin has evolved significantly since the last update, with 7 new orchestration workflows, a comprehensive preferences system, expanded security hardening, and new verification-before-completion enforcement. The gap between the site and the actual plugin is approximately 30-40% of the total documentation.

**Recommended action:** Prioritize Phase 1 critical updates for release with v0.13.1. Aim for completion of all three phases by v0.15.0.

Estimated total effort: **130-170 hours** across 22 new pages and 8 major updates, producing **26,000-33,000 words** of new documentation.
